"kpj15pl","18","We already saw him doing the mirror image of this—dropping prosecutions for political reasons—under Attorney General Bill Barr. I don’t see any reason to believe that Trump wouldn’t try to do this if reelected (especially if rumors of a Stephen Miller nomination for attorney general come true). In December 2020, Trump was cowed from appointing Jeff Clark as acting attorney general by threats of a mass resignation, but I’m not sure he would be again. For one thing, he’ll have his own appointees, and his allies are working hard to make sure those won’t be people like Richard Donoghue and Jeffrey Rosen, who stood up to Trump during the election-subversion effort. That means the people who will resign will be lower-ranking attorneys. The reaction, at least at first, will be: “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.” The administration may find later on that it’s hard to actually run the department without those people, though. I don’t want to say there’s no point at which the rest of the GOP would say “enough,” but I’ve been wrong over and over in the past when I predicted it. —David","politics","2024-02-08 19:32:07","1am29ty","theatlantic","0","18","0","True","2018-04-06 14:42:07","0.0","0.0","172832.0","45179.0","218011.0","61","Hey, Reddit, for The Atlantic’s January/February issue, 24 contributors consider what Donald Trump could do if he were to return to the White House.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial?

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

There is nothing stopping an individual state from deciding how to allocate thier electoral votes. THis is true. The problem hits with enforcement if one state decides they *won't* allocate the votes that way even though they have legislation that says they will. Faithless electors come to the forefront often and there is case history. This *would* happen the first time a state's electoral votes were to be assigned to the candidate that *didn't win that state*.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

When he won in 2016, he was plainly unprepared for the enormity of the presidential transition, and his tenure was less impactful as a result. Former members of his administration want to make sure it doesn’t happen again, but even with years of advance planning, a lot of the Project 2025 agenda would take months or even years to achieve because of regulatory roadblocks, congressional opposition, and the likelihood of legal challenges. —Russell

"kpizkbp","1","Hey there 👋,  
OP this is exactly what we've been working on for the last 7 years and it finally went live to the public on 1/1/24. The only way we get any reform (it didn’t pass when there was full Democratic control) is by removing some of the power from our representatives and giving it to the voters. Now you might say ""that’s impossible"", but we built an entire cutting edge system to do exactly that without breaking our representative democracy in any way. There are a ton of great ideas and initiatives out there that people are working on, but those ideas require existing politicians to pass laws that would limit their own power, very few politicians would agree to do that.   
That’s where Directed Democracy powered by StakeholdersVoice.com comes in. We’ve built an innovative new system that gives our members (American Citizens) direct control over creating policy, and then gets those same members elected to office to fight for those policies until they are passed into law. No more back room, pork barrel spending bills that are a thinly veiled transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top. No more excuses about why the most basic protections for the people of the United States just can’t be passed.   
Now you might be thinking “how will you get anyone to vote your members into office”. Obviously most of our members will vote for fellow members…you know...tribalism (but our tribe is completely nonpartisan and made up of every single American that wants real change and is tired of being ignored). The pitch to non-members is also simple, do you want empty promises or real power in the legislative process? Do you want power or paternalism that hasn’t worked? People want, and need, agency. When they don’t get it they start breaking things. I think we can all call a few examples of that little truth nugget to mind.   
So what will it be friends? Apathy or engagement, you can’t have it both ways. We built a solution, and now it’s up to you to build the community around it. Check it out and let us know what you think.","changemyview","2024-02-08 19:23:10","1allv84","Stakeholders_Voice","0","1","0","True","2024-02-02 00:10:13","0.0","0.0","5.0","4.0","9.0","123","And that includes working with the Democratic party **only until** we have achieved the systemic reforms necessary for more than two parties to compete in America.

We didn't see a single trans woman even make an Olympiad until the most recent one, a single weightlifter who only made the New Zealand team because of COVID restrictions allowing extra alternates. She scratched on all three initial lifts.

Still, even with that glaring sign there isn't an issue...the IOC still candied these prejudiced whiners asses and instituted even more stringent restrictions.

"kpizbnh","3","If we manage to create a black hole with this device it will weigh maybe a milligram, be about the size of a hydrogen atom, and convert well over a kilogram of its own mass to energy every second.  It only has a milligram of mass to convert.  A millisecond of lifetime.

You couldn't inject a that much mass into a space that small fast enough to keep it from evaporating no matter how hard you tried.  Imaginary feasibility for an operational black hole starts at like 10,000s of kilograms of mass, not milligrams or micrograms.

Sound difficult?

Well everything I said above is actually wrong, by several orders of magnitude.  This collider would make black holes weighing micrograms at best, which would convert a billion billion billion kilos of mass to energy every second, and the black holes would be about a million times small than a proton.  If you even wanted to feed it mass you'd have to bulls-eye it directly with the nucleus of atoms, and even then you'd still probably miss.

A black hole with a mass of 1 microgram has a lifetime of 10^-44 seconds, for clarity, that's 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds, light doesn't even travel the width of a proton in that amount time.

"kpiz7gf","2","There’s a fundamental weakness in the constitution.  What can disqualify a person from being President.  We don’t know but there certainly are things which are not in the constitution that should do that.  We can’t arrest a president in office.  Impeachment is the only check against his wrong doings.  But what if he kills/arrests/disappears the people who would impeach him for bad acts.  Is Trump beyond such acts and what future “leaders” see that as route to permanent presidency.

We have things you must be to be allowed to be president…35, natural born citizen…. Etc.  But what about things you can’t be.  Ideally we’d have a congress capable of resolving this by passing laws and amending the constitution.  But the steps required to resolve a weakness in the constitution are so unlikely to occur in today’s political environment that the constitution itself is the barrier to mitigating its own weakness.   

If we don’t fix ourselves…our divisions…we cannot fix congress…and we cannot fix the Constitution.   Everyone look in a mirror and come to the center.  Get off your “all or nothing ledges” and do the terrible thing that our democracy requires…Compromise.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

You accidentally trip over reality by stating the obvious,  ""H2 might be useful in niches like heavy equipment, and marine engines""

The majority of national emissions do not come from the private individual, their residential housing or their private vehicle.  The overwhelming majority of emissions comes from power generation, industry, and commercial and industrial transportation.

The problem with your comment is that you understated the market, its not fucking ""niche.""

Once people stop allowing nonsense takes such as yours to be taken as matter of fact, and start actually looking at the data, following the science.  Then there is progress towards reducing significant amount of emissions.

Last year you only had less than 2% reduction in U.S. emissions after the metric fuck ton of investment in EVs, heat pumps, e-bikes, renewables, whatever.  Building emissions dropped by 4%.  That would be a percentage of a percentage in relationship to total national emissions.  And natural gas usage in residential housing is only responsible for a little more than 4% of national emissions, so you are looking at an very small number.  And that drop in emissions could have been coming from moving away from coal fired power plants.  Emissions from coal dropped by 8% due to power generation from coal dropping by 2.5%.  

Transportation emissions rose by 1.6%, EV adoption is under 1% nationally with consumers primarily replacing passenger vehicles with EVs.  Passenger vehicles are only responsible for around 5% of national emissions.  The new CAFE EPA rules do not remove the exemptions or change the calculations that caused light duty vehicles to increase in size.  We will not be seeing smaller sized trucks, vans or suvs with significantly improved fuel economy any time soon.  And most of the emissions come from medium to heavy duty vehicles, commercial and industrial transportation anyways, not privately owned vehicles.

Industrial emissions rose by 1.2%.  With production of natural gas for industry and export doubling production of renewables.  Before this year only 15% of natural gas produced in the U.S. went to residences, after this year it will be less, because the U.S. has switched from an energy importer to an energy exporter.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

One the one hand, these sorts of resource problems tend to work themselves in both nature and human history; on the other hand, the way they work themselves out is through bloodshed and the slaughter of massive amounts of people.

What I am curious about is what is the endgame with regards to where our population ends up. More of an future looking anthropological discussion. Will our population eventually find an equilibrium point or will we just…go extinct (only being slightly facetious)? It will be a big move to go from a 0.7 fertility rate back up to a 2.0 in 50-100 years. 

Outside of some sort of conspiracy population thing by shady governments how would we wind down infrastructure? Would we clear it our just abandon it en masse?

What do you think is our population endgame? Any thoughts on what number will we end up at? Will we have to make a fundamental change to child bearing?

***

&gt;**Abstract**

&gt;The extent of grounded ice and buttressing by the Ronne Ice Shelf, which provides resistance to the outflow of ice streams, moderate West Antarctic Ice Sheet stability. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the ice sheet advanced and was grounded near the Weddell Sea continental shelf break. The timing of subsequent ice sheet retreat and the relative roles of ice shelf buttressing and grounding line changes remain unresolved. Here we use an ice core record from grounded ice at Skytrain Ice Rise to constrain the timing and speed of early Holocene ice sheet retreat. Measured δ18O and total air content suggest that the surface elevation of Skytrain Ice Rise decreased by about 450 m between 8.2 and 8.0 kyr before 1950 CE (±0.13 kyr). We attribute this elevation change to dynamic thinning due to flow changes induced by the ungrounding of ice in the area. Ice core sodium concentrations suggest that the ice front of this ungrounded ice shelf then retreated about 270 km (±30 km) from 7.7 to 7.3 kyr before 1950 CE. These centennial-scale changes demonstrate how quickly ice mass can be lost from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet due to changes in grounded ice without extensive ice shelf calving. Our findings both support and temporally constrain ice sheet models that exhibit rapid ice loss in the Weddell Sea sector in the early Holocene.","science","2024-02-08 19:01:21","1am39bc","avogadros_number","0","73","0","True","2013-05-10 02:07:55","0.0","0.0","508460.0","26237.0","534697.0","2883","","Evidence, contained within an ice core, shows that in one location the West Antarctic Ice Sheet thinned by 450 metres — that’s more than the height of the Empire State Building — in just under 200 years.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Just having access to the internet makes this likely. Your life will certainly change but the odds of *you* actually starving or dying from climate change is minimal.

This is just nonsense in the same way that billionaires make their apocalypse bunkers and think they'll live in the lap of luxury after shit hits the fan. Covid 19 lockdowns were just a demonstration in a hiccup of the logistics of it all, and rich assholes like other people doing the dirty work. There either won't be other people to do the dirty work, won't be the logistics necessary to do the dirty work, or both.

"kpiuygb","3","Depends what you consider dystopian but I think globally there will be cultural change towards a less individualistic and more communal family culture. It will happen some countries first and maybe different in each country but people will be expected to have children and to not will be considered selfish and you be considered not to be taking part in supporting community etc. Things that I think will support this move (which may take sometime to occur) but govt supports like pensions will disappear, security eg policing might get worse, as economies have trouble with shrinking populations. People will once again be reliant on the family unit to support each other and therefore there will be a benefit to have kids. Similar to how in tribal societies extended family structures are important because they serve some of the functions a well institutionalised govt provides in other countries eg security, job access, justice, and financing.
When these cultural changes happen and kick in I’m not really sure. I think societal breakdown will have to be really causing some effects first then a bit of time.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

Is there any real hope of avoiding widespread violence? I've read one article after another that warns of what's coming but provide little but platitudes and vague recommendations of things like education to remedy the problem, which of course the GOP will resist tooth and nail.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.

"kpis18p","3","I mean, something compared to nothing is always better. It's likely that an alternative, maybe using that power for chemical storage, will be more efficient though.

The calculations on how much power we can ideally store in gravity batteries are really simple. Take the mass, calculate how much energy is stored as potential energy and convert to Wh for practical reasons. Even if you do this assuming zero losses anywhere (and there's always loses both ways but we can assume input energy is free, we care only for the energy out) you get very little energy stored.

An example, let's say that we want to use something dense and lift it up quite high. A good choice in terms of density would be lead. An 1m³ cube of lead weighs ~11340kg so let's say we lift it 100m up. The potential energy stored is mass * gravity acceleration * height which gives you around 11 million joules. Sounds like a lot, but in context, you've just lifted the weight of seven cars almost 2/3rds of the way up the Great Pyramid of Giza and the energy you stored is only 3KWh and that's assuming lossless conversion to electricity on the way down.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kpir8pu","5","I also find CO2 Earth (link below) helpful.  It tracks CO2 levels year over year at a daily, weekly, monthly and annual granularity.  The sensor is located on Mauna Loa.  Daily readings are a bit more volatile than - weekly - monthly - etc.  As we know, annual co2 increases are scary but fairly stable.  Our annual increase rate is about 2.5 PPM mas o menos.  

I have been visiting the CO2 Earth site a few times a week for many years and the year over year daily readings are high quality.  Anyway, the last two days have been unlike anything I have seen before.  And the January year over year reading jumped 3.32 PPM which is much higher than normal.  

Yesterday and today were about a 6 PPM increase year over year.  I haven't ever seen anything remotely like that before.  I guess we will get a better picture in a week or so when they publish the rolling weekly year over year and even better than that in one month when they publish the results for February.  

I think everyone who sincerely tries to learn about the climate system understands that it has non linear components that interrelate in complex ways.  That said, one of MY biggest fears has been that we would set the seas abubble.... Here's to hoping this is some weird environmental spike.

In a natural ecosystem where you have all sorts of thriving plants, the high degree of genetic diversity makes your crops more resistant to ecological stress.

This highlights an important point, which is our methods of farming need to change. If humans were to alter their behavior and revert back to local community farming, farmers would have more options to diversify the types of crops and inter-species varieties being grown. More options for farmers means more protection against rising temperatures.

The biggest threat that we should be concerned about with regards to crops is pesticide, fungicide, herbicide, and fertilizer use. Seriously, go look at how many new chemical products are approved for use every year for agriculture, it is astonishing. We are doing irreversible damage to our own genetic lineages and the environment. I would be interested to see what kind of damage these chemicals are doing to field workers.

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

That's how you get famines, wasting limited research dollars on nonesense while real problems fester. The current situation can be addressed with better monitoring and forecasting of weather conditions, and better timing of when work occurs.

Submission Statement

I've never understood some people's fascination with space-based solar. Why go to all that over-engineered trouble to do something you can do on Earth anyway, except in an orders of magnitude simpler way.

Also, I love to see people devote efforts to space development, but it depresses me to see people do it and waste their time. I know it's a simplistic way of looking at things, but I wish they'd devote their time to something useful, like creating a commercial space station.

"kpip6al","1","No not really. First, let me say this idea stinks of easy corruption. Anyone can make a media company these days and you'd just be siphoning money from the taxpayers into this infinite amount of potential candidates and the media company that props them up. 


But primarily if you're looking at the current freely chosen value of an average campaign, then taxing everyone to give to politicians to get them to that price point you're just distorting the market. The prices for advertising would just go up and up as these new players enter the arena. The corporations that had the money to do it in the first place may be pushed out of being able to still make political material as but then you're just pushing out the poorest organizations in the political arena. 


You're distorting the very market you're trying to use as a price signal. The rich will still be able to independently advocate for themselves. Corporations like the NRA, major Hollywood producers, big oil/pharma will still be major players you'll just be making it more expensive to take media space. 


This is what I feel like folks like you don't understand is that money is just a signal we use for the exchanges and debt. The real resources, in this case people's attention to the media, is the scarce resource that is still going to be desired and so those with the means will still be seen as outperforming those without the means. 


This is seen time and time again in education and Healthcare where things get ever expensive where gov has to provide the baseline. While we have accepted an elite will get an ever higher valued education and increasing prices to keep up, and there are good arguments for total nationalization of Healthcare, this problem of government involvement is purely negative when it comes to political speech. 


Again either you're pushing the price of entry up OR you monopolize the given resource. 


In no way is that acceptable for our right to politically advocate. I understand it sucks that this favors the rich the way it is, but reality favors the rich.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

The issue examines the effects of a possible second Trump term on the health of democracy, rule of law, corruption, foreign policy, immigration, extremism, science, climate, culture, journalism, and more. “Over time, the shock of Trump’s rhetoric has worn off,” David wrote in his essay, “making it easy to miss the fact that his message has grown even darker.”

Trump continues to be the prohibitive favorite for the 2024 GOP nomination, clearing the field of all candidates except Nikki Haley, who has trailed him in the primaries so far. As political reporters for The Atlantic, we have covered his first presidency, his time out of office, his new campaign, his GOP opponents, and the Republican response to his continued domination over the party, both in Washington, D.C., and across the country.

"kpinlfb","1","&gt;According to one analysis of U.S. government data, EV fires appear to occur less frequently than ICE vehicles, with 25.1 fires for every 100,000 vehicles sold compared to 1,529 fires for ICE vehicles.


I'm not talking about fires while they are still being used as an EV, I am talking about after their ev life has been depleted. Each used pack would need to be assessed for potentially bad cells which would need to be replaced and even then, you would get another few years out of it in energy storage before it needs to be recycled. 

Which brings the question, if cobalt and Nickel are no longer needed for use in new batteries is it worth the cost of recycling the batteries? And the answer seems to be no. At that point EV's will come with an environmental disposal fee (TAX) attached to their purchase price, like we see for electronic devises (tv's, computers). 

I have never been anti battery, I am just not some 1 dimensional Tesla fanboy. Putting li ion batteries into everything from a scooter to a semi truck is not a sustainable answer.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"
"kpimrr6","6","I'll start with some of the more fundamental bits, then move into some of the practical criticisms of why your preferred policies would have the opposite effect than what you desire. 

&gt; I still believe in Democracy 

Then how can you consider yourself an anti-Capitalist then? Without capitalism, how do we have the necessary freedoms needed to have a viable democracy? If the government controls all the news-media, what political incentive is there to allow opposition ideas on the airwaves, in the press or on the Internet? That's the thing about capitalism: if you have the resources to pay for it, the profit creates the incentives to get your ideas out there. A book publisher doesn't have to agree with your ideas, they just have to agree that there's an audience that's willing to pay for them.

Unless democracy is merely a means to an end here and not a value unto itself.

&gt;  Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.

This cuts both ways though. This is also likely to eliminate the election-math penalty for centrist candidates if the parties choose to put forth unacceptably extreme candidates on both ends. If anything, this might function to give more centrist candidates something of an advantage. That's a feature for me, but I doubt it's one for you.

&gt;Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns.

We live in the era of the small dollar donor. Campaign contributions to politicians are limited to what, [$5000 in most federal elections](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/)? Nobody's 'buying' a politician with a contribution like that. Candidate committees increasingly don't need party's approval *because* of their ability to fundraise off of smaller-dollar donors too. 

&gt; If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

Even if all this goes according to plan, you'd have a coalition government where you're still in the minority. If you get elected at all, that is. It'd be much better to try to take over the DNC much as Trump managed to take over the GOP. Find some air-head celebrity to convince that Stalin really was the good guy and put him or her up for President in a populist spasm where ideas and policy don't really matter, then let the effect trickle down into the rest of the party. That's a much shorter path to GULAGs of your dreams than trying to build up a coalition around policy ideas that are deeply unpopular in present American politics.","changemyview","2024-02-08 18:12:35","1allv84","username_6916","0","6","0","True","2012-12-08 22:34:22","0.0","0.0","8890.0","43182.0","52072.0","123","And that includes working with the Democratic party **only until** we have achieved the systemic reforms necessary for more than two parties to compete in America.

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution.

   Were it me and I understand Israel’s right to existence and yes I agree with you about refugees and the economy. Even I who views America as a nation of immigrants do not believe it needs too much refugees and they can certainly be problematic at times. But have no issues with any country taking in small numbers and Israel should and have taken in refugees before even non-Jews and non-Europeans (Vietnam for example).

Regarding the Jews for open borders again from what I’ve seen largely they don’t and not just conservatives but also leftists Jews aren’t the biggest fan of open borders for economic reasons and it seems to be more of an American liberal perspective of bringing in more refugees or something like that, which yes there are Jews that do this and it is annoying but I personally haven’t seen anything widespread like this and if it happened that there were Jews more in favor of immigration I don’t think it extends to the point of Open borders that is extremist!","changemyview","2024-02-08 18:07:11","1alvzz3","Any-Emu-570","0","2","0","True","2023-07-20 19:05:38","0.0","0.0","250.0","240.0","490.0","0"," Disclaimer: I know this is an antisemitic canard, I really wish I wouldn’t hold these views but unfortunately my bias for it has shown and I can’t seem to think otherwise from what I’ve witnessed so let me say some things before anyone tries to argue otherwise:

 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial?

But not today’s climatologists. They have a much better explanation now. 

I’m convinced Climate Science isn’t based on science at all. Its become a cash grab industry (courtesy of Al Gore) that’s funded on the backs of US taxpayers who, by the way, are also funding wars in other parts of the world.

Here’s just one example. The attached article explains a mini Ice Age that occurred during the Middle Ages and ended at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. It offers 4 theories as to why this cooling period occurred:

1. A decrease in sunspot activity - Very plausible because the sun has a direct impact on the climate

2. An increase in volcanic eruptions - Plausible because volcanic activity has a direct impact on the climate

3. Significant changes in atmospheric patterns - Possible, but no explanation as to why the changes occurred

4. After Europeans arrived, 50,000,000 indigenous people died in the Americas between 1500 and 1600, and so many trees grew back in the following years that it lowered global temperatures 1.8-3.6 degrees - Dubious if not plain dumb. 

Indigenous Americans did not use draft animals and metal tools (Europeans did), so how exactly were they able to clear so much forested land (millions upon millions of acres) that its replenishment would alter the global climate?

Guess which theory is most popular with the media and the Climate Kleptocracy?

The 4th theory (which the media portrays as fact) got attention in early 2019. The mainstream media ran with it because the narrative of Anthropomorphic Climate Change is the exact kind of sensationalism that is needed to scare the Western World into submission, and keep those climate scientists well-funded - with OUR tax dollars.   

Its my understanding that NOAA scientists lose funding dollars if their findings don’t correlate with those in the political end of government. Some surprise there. I’m sure that’s also the case with other agencies like the EPA. 

Its foolish to assume the climate isn’t changing. It has never stopped changing. I’m all for responsible environmental stewardship and believe the US and Canada do more than their fair share. 

But for politicians to misuse taxpayer dollars to stop Earth from doing what Earth’s going to do? How stupid are we to put up with this nonsense?","What really caused the Little Ice Age?","0.93","37","0","2024-02-08 17:23:13"

"kpikl4b","22","It’s official: For the past 12 months, the Earth was [1.5 degrees Celsius higher](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/03/july-blows-away-temperature-records-testing-key-climate-threshold/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2) than in preindustrial times, scientists said Thursday, crossing a critical barrier into temperatures never experienced by human civilizations.

According to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, the past 12 months clocked in at a scorching 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) higher on average compared with between 1850 and 1900.

At some level, that’s not surprising — the past 12 months have been scorching, as a warm [El Niño cycle](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/02/08/la-nina-watch-el-nino-demise/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) combined with the signal of [human-caused warming](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/07/michael-mann-climate-trial/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) generated heat waves and extreme weather events around the globe.

“This El Nino maximum is riding on top of a base climate that is continuously warming due to climate change,” Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University, said in an email. “The combination of them is what’s giving us such hot global temperatures.”

But does this mean that the world’s most famous climate goal is out of reach? Not ... exactly.

Here’s what you need to know:

***Where did the 1.5 Celsius goal come from?***

In the 2016 Paris climate agreement, almost 200 nations agreed to keep the global average temperature from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels — and to “pursue efforts” to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The latter addition largely came from pressure from small-island states, who are at risk of disappearing under rising seas if temperatures get much higher.

Scientists have shown that holding the temperature rise to 1.5C could mean the survival of coral reefs, the preservation of Arctic sea ice and less deadly heat waves.

Momentum has gathered around that more ambitious goal — even as carbon emissions continue to rise. Activists and environmentalists have chanted “1.5 to stay alive” and pointed out that [emissions will have to be cut dramatically](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/02/06/europe-climate-emissions-protests/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16) by 2030 to meet that target.

But not today’s climatologists. They have a much better explanation now. 

I’m convinced Climate Science isn’t based on science at all. Its become a cash grab industry (courtesy of Al Gore) that’s funded on the backs of US taxpayers who, by the way, are also funding wars in other parts of the world.

Here’s just one example. The attached article explains a mini Ice Age that occurred during the Middle Ages and ended at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. It offers 4 theories as to why this cooling period occurred:

1. A decrease in sunspot activity - Very plausible because the sun has a direct impact on the climate

2. An increase in volcanic eruptions - Plausible because volcanic activity has a direct impact on the climate

3. Significant changes in atmospheric patterns - Possible, but no explanation as to why the changes occurred

4. After Europeans arrived, 50,000,000 indigenous people died in the Americas between 1500 and 1600, and so many trees grew back in the following years that it lowered global temperatures 1.8-3.6 degrees - Dubious if not plain dumb. 

Indigenous Americans did not use draft animals and metal tools (Europeans did), so how exactly were they able to clear so much forested land (millions upon millions of acres) that its replenishment would alter the global climate?

Guess which theory is most popular with the media and the Climate Kleptocracy?

The 4th theory (which the media portrays as fact) got attention in early 2019. The mainstream media ran with it because the narrative of Anthropomorphic Climate Change is the exact kind of sensationalism that is needed to scare the Western World into submission, and keep those climate scientists well-funded - with OUR tax dollars.   

Its my understanding that NOAA scientists lose funding dollars if their findings don’t correlate with those in the political end of government. Some surprise there. I’m sure that’s also the case with other agencies like the EPA. 

Its foolish to assume the climate isn’t changing. It has never stopped changing. I’m all for responsible environmental stewardship and believe the US and Canada do more than their fair share. 

But for politicians to misuse taxpayer dollars to stop Earth from doing what Earth’s going to do? How stupid are we to put up with this nonsense?","What really caused the Little Ice Age?","0.93","37","0","2024-02-08 17:23:13"

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

**3.** A fire in Port Huron, Michigan destroyed 1.2 million acres. This fire and the Peshtigo Fire were absolute monsters: for reference, they each destroyed 100x the amount of land the Maui wildfires from last year did. Port Huron is 100s of miles away from the other 2 fires. 

**4.** A fire in Manistee, Michigan wiped the town off the face of the Earth and left thousands homeless

**5.** A massive fire in Holland, Michigan flattened over 300 homes and basically destroyed the town.

\----------------

All of these fires were happening simultaneously, hundreds of miles apart, nowhere near each other. 

This is the strangest thing ever!! 

And some think a COMET crashed to earth that night and caused this outbreak of fires. 

There are a lot of very strange eyewitness accounts that support the comet theory. The descriptions of how these fires behaved is not normal. Fireproof buildings in Chicago literally melted in a few seconds. Witnesses reported balls of fire falling from the sky in Peshtigo. 

IDK what to believe but this is a weird one.

For example; our internet started to malfunction and dropping intermittently about a week after we got it installed.

I googled around for a moment and discovered it might be the cords they’re using and the way they’re bent. Went thru and taped the cords up and straightened them out a bit and BAM. Internet works now. I am not that smart or anything I just googled. It seems obsurd to me how many people are not capable of simple basic problem solving.

A good example is that the car insurance company i've had for 5 years now tells me that there are no longer month to month options for payment plans and that they only accept 6 month payments so they can ""Lock-in their premium package prices."" What does it mean ""Lock-in"" their premiums. Get an upfront payment, and sure you might get a lower deal and save maybe a few hundred bucks on it... but then.... where's the flexibility for those who don't have that money to spend for 6 month premiums? And what my friend brought up was ""Regressive behavior"" which is to create something, make it beneficial in the beginning with all the bells and whistles and deals and %'s off and bundles and then over time it takes it away. ""Oh we no longer have that deal. Oh we no longer provide that service, oh that's no longer apart of this bundle."" Why not? what happened?   


My other friend just got evicted. He lived at an apartment for 3 months, did an application for his income range, showed the exact amount he was making, what he had in reserves etc etc. They increase his rent by 350$. So then what was the point of qualifying for the income range to live there?   


""Well it's because of inflation and that's just how it works."" Well... i'm in my early 20's. It's clearly not working and it seems like it's going backwards. ""Regressing"" from how it was. And it seems to me that the same people telling us ""It's inflation and this is how the system and economy and things work"" are the same ones making it Not Work. And this may seem very barebones and ""top of the hour"" for conspiracies, but it opens up a perception. Being able to see Regressive Patters and Behaviors is the first step towards stopping it.    


We get told ""There's not enough food for everyone and we gotta fight over resources and land eventually and global warming"". Who said that? Same people?

“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc.

There is a lack of services  like roads and schools as is (because a lot of the budget goes on security purposes) And we don't have a lot of foreign workers, and the ones that stay for a long time can get through a certain no so easy process citizenship or at the very least residency.   
I don't know whether Jews abroad call for open borders or not, I'm guessing that some do and some don't and it's related to their political affiliation. This should be a country related question IMO. For instance, I know Germany is heavily dependent on immigration, while other countries are less dependent on it. Sometimes mass immigration boosts the economy and sometimes sinks it.

This is a database of migration to countries, it looks like Israel is in a middle spot in terms of net migration and it fluctuates over the years. from getting a lot of immigrants to getting fairly little amount.    


 What I do agree with you is about refugees. Israeli politicians have made specifically bad policies in term of accepting refugees in the past (with Ukrainian refugees being a positive outline). I think some countries should accept more refugees in general, including Israel as long as their economy allows for it (and the Israeli economy definitely wouldn't crash because of a small amount of people). I don't think that the  justification of this is because of trying to maintain a Jewish majority (cause the number of refugees we're talking about is just some tens of thousands), it's just because of ""regular"" rejection for refugees. I think specifically Israel has an even higher obligation to accept refugees given the history of the Jewish people, but probably out of short term political incentives the government doesn't agree with me.","changemyview","2024-02-08 17:53:48","1alvzz3","comeon456","0","2","0","True","2023-06-03 07:40:59","0.0","0.0","350.0","21170.0","21520.0","0"," Disclaimer: I know this is an antisemitic canard, I really wish I wouldn’t hold these views but unfortunately my bias for it has shown and I can’t seem to think otherwise from what I’ve witnessed so let me say some things before anyone tries to argue otherwise:

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial?

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kpihr56","15","These alarming climate reports indicate the world has surpassed a key warming threshold, yet the corporate push for return to office (RTO) is driven by real estate interests over environmental impacts or commuting challenges due to extreme weather changes. 

The rally for ""NOW GET YOUR ASSES BACK ON THE ROAD AND IN THE OFFICE"" ignores the necessity for operational resilience amid our climate crisis.

RTO exacerbates commuting, contributing to higher carbon emissions, and disregards the need for companies to reassess the environmental footprint of mandating office attendance. Sustainable commuting options like public transportation, carpooling, or maintaining flexible remote work arrangements are essential.

As climate change escalates, companies face pressure to align their policies with sustainability goals. RTO mandates neglecting potential for elevated greenhouse gas emissions starkly conflict with corporate sustainability objectives and public expectations for environmental stewardship.

The warming threshold milestone demands innovative approaches to work organization. Companies have the opportunity to adopt work models minimizing the need for physical office space, reducing heating, cooling, and lighting demands, and contributing to lower overall energy consumption and emissions.

Companies must recognize their role in combating climate change by fostering operational resilience and rethinking traditional work arrangements, contributing to climate action while adapting to our warming world.","news","2024-02-08 17:44:58","1altje3","roboticArrow","0","15","0","True","2015-10-19 05:17:12","1746.0","286.0","40067.0","32019.0","74118.0","4820","","World surpasses key warming threshold across an entire year for the first time","0.94","4820","0","2024-02-08 11:23:55"

P.S.

Thus you obtain a monobloc of concrete which can be lowered and heightened per desire. And the motor/generator can be one adapted from these smart trams, lol, which generate electricity from braking.

3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

A good example is that the car insurance company i've had for 5 years now tells me that there are no longer month to month options for payment plans and that they only accept 6 month payments so they can ""Lock-in their premium package prices."" What does it mean ""Lock-in"" their premiums. Get an upfront payment, and sure you might get a lower deal and save maybe a few hundred bucks on it... but then.... where's the flexibility for those who don't have that money to spend for 6 month premiums? And what my friend brought up was ""Regressive behavior"" which is to create something, make it beneficial in the beginning with all the bells and whistles and deals and %'s off and bundles and then over time it takes it away. ""Oh we no longer have that deal. Oh we no longer provide that service, oh that's no longer apart of this bundle."" Why not? what happened?   


My other friend just got evicted. He lived at an apartment for 3 months, did an application for his income range, showed the exact amount he was making, what he had in reserves etc etc. They increase his rent by 350$. So then what was the point of qualifying for the income range to live there?   


""Well it's because of inflation and that's just how it works."" Well... i'm in my early 20's. It's clearly not working and it seems like it's going backwards. ""Regressing"" from how it was. And it seems to me that the same people telling us ""It's inflation and this is how the system and economy and things work"" are the same ones making it Not Work. And this may seem very barebones and ""top of the hour"" for conspiracies, but it opens up a perception. Being able to see Regressive Patters and Behaviors is the first step towards stopping it.    


We get told ""There's not enough food for everyone and we gotta fight over resources and land eventually and global warming"". Who said that? Same people? Well I just took a plane from one place to another and you're telling me that when I look down at what i'm flying over that we can't produce a vast amount of farms and resources in every state?

H2 electrolysis has variable efficiency.  Usually goal is to produce as much as possible driving efficiency below 60% (55kwh/kg).  But with batteries, it can also be 70%+ efficient over longer hours of operation (40kwh/kg).

H2 as heat is 100% efficient.  Electricity from a FC is usually more valuable, but waste heat in a home FC corresponds to energy fraction typical of domestic hot water use.  Waste heat also would amplify heat pump efficiency that would require more expensive electrical distribution networks than gas/h2 distribution.

As vehicle fuel, H2 can be cheaper due to faster refueling (more kwh/hour transferred), easier infrastructure, and making H2 from surplus renewables, instead of requiring an electric producer to be on other end of charging wire.","energy","2024-02-08 17:38:58","1alumav","MBA922","0","6","0","False","","10.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","10.0","145","","Battery storage plus hydrogen can enable a reliable, cheap clean energy transition.

“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23).

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.

"kpif96q","1","&gt;The temperature measures used in the IPCC are a **rolling average of the last 30** years.

You're wrong, that's not what a 30-year average for a given year means, and IPCC does not measure current year's temperatures.

Proposed method for determining long-term average for a given year is taking an average of previous 10/15 years and the following 10/15 years. We know that the average for current year is 1.2-1.3c from data from previous 10 years and projections for the next 10 years.

""The widely available global average temperature for a specific year isn't a suitable indicator for determining if the ""Paris 1.5"" threshold has been surpassed. The Paris Agreement focuses on long-term warming trends rather than yearly fluctuations. However, there has not been a formally agreed-upon alternative approach established yet.

""Clarity on breaching the Paris Agreement guard rails will be crucial. Without an agreement on what actually will count as exceeding 1.5 °C, we risk distraction and confusion at precisely the time when action to avoid the worst effects of climate change becomes even more urgent.""-

Richard A. Betts MBE, Study Lead Author and Head, Climate Impacts Research, Met Office Hadley Center

""Betts says, “Using the average global temperature over the last 20 years would mean we would have to wait ten years to confirm whether the 1.5 °C ceiling has been reached: creating a decade of otherwise preventable delay. Today we are recommending an indicator combining the last ten years of global temperature observations with an estimate of the projection or forecast for the next ten years. If adopted, this could mean a universally agreed measure of global warming that could trigger immediate action to avoid further rises.”

The scientists found that the figure for the current global warming level is around 1.26 °C using this recommended approach, with an uncertainty range of 1.13 °C to 1.43 °C.""

&gt;What we've heard recently from James Hansen is really quite scary

You shouldn't make any conclusions from a single study. There were a bunch of climate models in CMIP6(a set of models used in IPCC 6th assessment report) that showed a climate sensitivity(ECS is a metric of how much warmer the climate would be when earth reaches equilibrium after doubling of co2 levels compared to pre-industrial) similar to what is claimed in this study(up to 5.6c), way higher than the range from previous reports. However, scientists who worked on them and the report found that these models overestimate future warming(conclusion was based on paleoclimate data and other lines of evidence) and narrowed the range used in the report down to 2.5-4c, so actual ECS ending up beyond that range is not very likely.

""others have used similar approach to Hansen et al and come up with very different results. The point here is that sensitivity is a big enough problem that it requires a synthesis of available evidence, rather than overhyping any individual paper. ""

As with carbon-capture, carbon-credits and such, the campaign for ""green H2"" is being pushed by Big Oil&amp;Gas. The engineering arguments are what matters, but the public discussion is warped, just as the climate change discussion, before it, was warped by propaganda.

Also the general public is extremely naive and unthoughtful:

Often people try to argue for a 100% solution across all niches, or expect the replacements for fossil fuels to be as easy to use.

On-the-street citizen and on-deadline journalist have  no concept of gradual improvements toward a goal, which is basic engineering.

Systems engineering is hard, and requires a lot of data and knowledge.

Anyway, H2 might be useful in niches like heavy equipment, and marine engines. A friend asked for example, how to power the big gang-plow tractors in Australia where he lives with batteries. They require a steady power output that could never be supplied with transportable batteries. I suspect we won't have a solution for this kind of use in my lifetime.

There is a great deal of historical debate about the specifics. Yes, some were expelled in the context of a brutal war in which newly created Israelis were immediately attacked the moment their nation was ratified by a vote of the general assembly of the UN, in an attempt to exterminate them. Raids and atrocities were committed in both directions. 

Israel won. 

During and following this war, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians chose to leave. 

In addition, a larger number of Jews were driven out of Arab nations than Palestinians were driven out of Palestine. 

The 150,000 Palestinians who chose to stay were granted Israeli citizenship and the right to vote. This is an indisputable historical fact. That’s a very odd thing for a group who intended to ethnically cleanse the region on racial grounds to do. Sounds more like they fought a war for their own survival which was absolutely brutal and a whole host of things resulted from their winning it, including being incredibly gracious to those on the other side who made it clear they didn’t intend to continue trying to genocide them.","changemyview","2024-02-08 17:27:07","1alvzz3","Pale_Zebra8082","0","5","0","True","2023-07-07 17:47:55","0.0","0.0","111.0","27571.0","27682.0","0"," Disclaimer: I know this is an antisemitic canard, I really wish I wouldn’t hold these views but unfortunately my bias for it has shown and I can’t seem to think otherwise from what I’ve witnessed so let me say some things before anyone tries to argue otherwise:

What would this new one go after? There's nothing but loose ideas without much substance behind these 'new physics' that particle physicists want the taxpayers to shell out 20B for.

This new collider would be nothing but a way to guarantee work and retirement for thousands of physicists and engineers without getting anything substantial in return for this insane amount of money.","Futurology","2024-02-08 17:20:27","1alz6gf","a_saddler","0","5","0","True","2017-08-17 15:56:45","1119.0","0.0","40974.0","134104.0","176197.0","4361","","Will people again be afraid of the creation of a black hole on Earth?

Do you mean this that is the total opposite of what you claimed?

&gt;**Dozens of massacres** were conducted by Israeli military forces and between 400 and 600 Palestinian villages were destroyed.

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial?

 Ofc the belief that Jews in the West are saying “open borders and more migrants!” But keeping Israel closed, this always lingers in my mind and I wish to not have it because otherwise I am actually pretty pro-israel and not from some “right wing “ or “left wing” perspective I just view Israel as cool and Jewish people as really cool.","changemyview","2024-02-08 17:17:43","1alvzz3","Any-Emu-570","0","1","0","True","2023-07-20 19:05:38","0.0","0.0","250.0","240.0","490.0","0"," Disclaimer: I know this is an antisemitic canard, I really wish I wouldn’t hold these views but unfortunately my bias for it has shown and I can’t seem to think otherwise from what I’ve witnessed so let me say some things before anyone tries to argue otherwise:

Interesting that you push hydrogen but when I counter you then bring up the sodium batteries.  Recycling aside since someone will find it worth recycling them in or out of the US, I dont think sodium negates lithium batteries.  Even if they aren't recycled, those batteries each saved us from lots of petroleum fuels in an ICE and a great deal of pollution in the those battery packs should be compared to the pollution in the air it saved. I'd rather have battery packs to recycle than the expense to society to pull CO2 out of the air.

How are the taxpayers being charged for the lithium batteries to be recycled?

Edited my goof, sorry OP.

Another large fire occurred in 1881, if anyone is interested, called the Great Thumb Fire.

 In wheatland and surrounding townships, in 1881, which doesn't really exist any more.  There's currently a Wheatland, MI, but it's in a whole different area, down by Illinois or Indiana I believe.  

I have a great great great (great?) Grandmother and great great aunt that were trapped and died in that fire with some other family members, not looking at my tree right now so can't be specific.  Anyway, they are buried in Wheatland cemetery together, [here is the stone.](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/73618919/clara-howard)


Morbidly funny, my ancestors did move down to Port Huron after 1881, I wonder if they got the news of the 1871 fire and thought ""whew!

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

**3.** A fire in Port Huron, Michigan destroyed 1.2 million acres. This fire and the Peshtigo Fire were absolute monsters: for reference, they each destroyed 100x the amount of land the Maui wildfires from last year did. Port Huron is 100s of miles away from the other 2 fires. 

**4.** A fire in Manistee, Michigan wiped the town off the face of the Earth and left thousands homeless

**5.** A massive fire in Holland, Michigan flattened over 300 homes and basically destroyed the town.

\----------------

All of these fires were happening simultaneously, hundreds of miles apart, nowhere near each other. 

This is the strangest thing ever!! 

And some think a COMET crashed to earth that night and caused this outbreak of fires. 

There are a lot of very strange eyewitness accounts that support the comet theory. The descriptions of how these fires behaved is not normal. Fireproof buildings in Chicago literally melted in a few seconds. Witnesses reported balls of fire falling from the sky in Peshtigo. 

IDK what to believe but this is a weird one.

And I've no doubt Hitler would have tried to destroy Israel, but that doesn't mean that Anti Semites weren't involved in its creation.

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc.

\-  if modern-day palestenians started to settle in the region after the jews that doesn't mean that they aren't indigenous; I don't know what makes you indigenous more than living continuously in the same area for about 2000 years. By that same logic, modern-day americans have no place in America because they are the descendants of europeans who invaded the region 300 years ago when the land belonged to the indigenous American population. The plot twist, but an obvious thing, is that genetically palestinians are direct descendants of the ancient Israelites; they are jews who converted to christianity and then converted to islam. They are more ethnically israelites than most large jewish groups especailly askenazi jews whose europian ancestory is more than 50% while palestinian muslims have arab ancestory of only 20 to 30%. It is more striking when in comparison, palestinian muslims are more genetically close to askinazi jews than Saudi arabs, but yemenite jews are more arab than palestinian muslims.

I guess you refer to Israel's immigration law that allows every Jewish person to achieve Israeli citizenship.   
This does not mean that you cannot immigrate to Israel out of other reasons, and I personally know a non Jewish person that got a citizenship because he worked for several years in Israel and applied. You could also apply for citizenship if you're a married partner of an Israeli, whether this person is Jewish, Muslim, Christian Druze, or any other person. Many children of foreign workers get automatic citizenship etc.

You are familiar with the fact that there are Jewish citizens that aren't Jewish. I assume you are familiar that you can work in Israel even if you're not Jewish.

So what's the point? any sovereign party could declare any group eligible for citizenship. and can decline any specific people from accepting citizenship. For instance, specifically Jewish people were allowed to get Spanish and Portuguese passports based on their ancestor's expulsion like 500 years ago - how is that different?  


Is what you're claiming that Israeli immigration policy has no kin in other countries? or that any country wouldn't be able to do so? cause the second isn't true.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc.

"kpiasql","1","Very well put... Thank you for the post. My big point I'm subconsciously arriving at (I think) is it also doesn't speak to actual efficiency. Actual efficiency meaning it changes behavior to use less. Not some expensive coping mechanism that allows us to say ""we can keep doing what we are doing but produce it THIS way instead of the old way, ya know... Because we are filled with environmental guilt about our excess""

Watching the nation finally arrive at the fallacy behind every car should be replaced by an EV is the perfect example. It almost like EV has great applications for certain parts of our society, not a one size fits all approach. The solution is to consume less, not buy a new widget to fix the problem under the ""pitch"" of sustainability so we continue to consume the same or more. In my opinion we only have a finite amount of chances to get the general public to ""buy in"" to being more conscious about the issues we face, and headlines like the one for the Superbowl being ""sustainable"" only misinform the public and further divide the solution from our perception of reality. 

Outlandish and absurd I know and we are no longer talking about energy, we are talking about social dilemmas but the point remains. The headline is bogus.","energy","2024-02-08 17:06:34","1al3j98","tellyourwifilover","0","1","0","True","2021-01-29 18:25:59","0.0","0.0","242.0","297.0","539.0","0","Ok so I'm not in the industry but I do have an economics degree and used to be in solar sales here in NY...

CBS mornings just did a story about the Superbowl being the first one 100% powered by renewable energy (we'll assume most games in Allegiant Arena are powered this way and the Superbowl isn't unique but whatever). The story goes on from the egregious power needed for a large black colored arena to hold thousands of people and keep it A/C'ed in a desert and moves onto the contracted power supply of an endless horizon of solar farms a few miles away and the very large ""battery supply"" to store the power when the sun goes down. 

I'm a huge fan of progress and innovation, and lets not fool ourselves... The climate is changing and we need to do something about it. That being said... This sounds like an exceptionally inefficient process, and merely a pitch that is used to make live in a desert ""sustainable"". Am I wrong?

Hear me out... So when I was in solar here in NY, you could not keep your energy you produced, you had to put it collectively into the grid along with everyone else, for efficiency. Battery back up sounds absurd considering the grid just pulls power from elsewhere when the sun goes down therefore making the battery back up ineffective. Right? And unless the solar farm has transmission lines directly to the stadium, it just pulls power directly from the grid so the stadium must just use less than the solar field produces making the whole claim just a pitch to give off the illusion of green tech. The story should have been: ""Look at this solar field, it produces enough power in a week to power the super bowl at night for 8 whole hours!"" 

I understand the whole deregulation of energy supply from the delivery to give the illusion of control over your supply from the customers standpoint (which actually just means less protection for the consumer) that makes this green claim possible, but this just seems so odd. Such an American take on sustainability, oasis in the desert dripping in excess and made famous for gluttony deems itself green because of solar power?

“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc.

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly.

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

**3.** A fire in Port Huron, Michigan destroyed 1.2 million acres. This fire and the Peshtigo Fire were absolute monsters: for reference, they each destroyed 100x the amount of land the Maui wildfires from last year did. Port Huron is 100s of miles away from the other 2 fires. 

**4.** A fire in Manistee, Michigan wiped the town off the face of the Earth and left thousands homeless

**5.** A massive fire in Holland, Michigan flattened over 300 homes and basically destroyed the town.

\----------------

All of these fires were happening simultaneously, hundreds of miles apart, nowhere near each other. 

This is the strangest thing ever!! 

And some think a COMET crashed to earth that night and caused this outbreak of fires. 

There are a lot of very strange eyewitness accounts that support the comet theory. The descriptions of how these fires behaved is not normal. Fireproof buildings in Chicago literally melted in a few seconds. Witnesses reported balls of fire falling from the sky in Peshtigo. 

IDK what to believe but this is a weird one.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

I just wanted to say that I really appreciate your viewpoint, beyond this sub or this thread. It is one that is rarely acknowledged on Reddit as acceptable, and it forms a lot of my opinion on the situation. The fact that yourself, being Jewish, sees it the same reminds me that I am not insane.

It's not right to displace people who live somewhere, regardless of the reasoning behind it. Put yourself in their shoes, you know?

I am of Acadian descendance, and in 1755, the British forcibly removed my family from Acadia. Every year we celebrate the fact that we still exist, and that we survived. Our culture is celebrated worldwide now. Yet, is it so different that the Palestinians?

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kpi8far","1","The following submission statement was provided by /u/chrisdh79:

---

From the article: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest particle accelerator in the world. It will remain so for a long time, but CERN is already moving forward with plans to create a much larger collider.

CERN initially unveiled plans for the new accelerator in 2019. Now the center says it wants its construction plans to be approved within five years, which would put the collider up and running in the 2040s.

More precisely, during this period the installation will work as part of the first stage, when scientists will collide electrons and positrons. The second phase will be implemented only in the 2070s – then protons will begin to collide at the accelerator.

The cost of the new installation is estimated at 20 billion euros. For comparison, the LHC cost $6 billion and took seven years to build.

The new accelerator will have a circumference of 91 km versus almost 27 km for the LHC. This should make it possible to achieve energies of the order of 100 TeV, while the LHC, after modernization, offers only 14 TeV.

The new installation, thanks to higher energies, may allow the discovery of so-called new physics. Including particles beyond the standard model and, for example, revealing the secrets of dark matter. For example, the LHC made it possible to detect the Higgs boson, which was theoretically predicted 50 years before its discovery. True, many scientists express doubts about the advisability of building a new accelerator, since it is far from certain that even these energies will be enough to discover something completely new.

&gt;Confronting the climate crisis won’t be cheap. California is trying to figure out who will pay.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under a series of proposals being considered by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s appointees to the Public Utilities Commission, the wealthy would be forced to cough up, in the form of flat fees on their monthly electric bills. But so would middle-class families.  
&gt;  
&gt;The debate has raised difficult questions of socioeconomic justice and climate progress — and prompted a group of Democratic lawmakers to try to repeal a monthly fee requirement they approved less than two years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;The details are complicated. I’ll do my best to explain the competing arguments.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the result needs to be wealthier Californians paying more for power.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Electricity rates are rising for everyone,” said Alexis Sutterman, a staffer at the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “But it’s especially burdening those who already pay a disproportionate amount of their income on their utility bills.”  
&gt;  
&gt;With bills continuing to rise, “we want to make sure there are protections in place for low-income customers,” she said.

"kpi7lrl","1","Hey all, I hope you'll read my latest L.A. Times column and let me know what you think! Here's how it starts:

&gt;Confronting the climate crisis won’t be cheap. California is trying to figure out who will pay.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under a series of proposals being considered by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s appointees to the Public Utilities Commission, the wealthy would be forced to cough up, in the form of flat fees on their monthly electric bills. But so would middle-class families.  
&gt;  
&gt;The debate has raised difficult questions of socioeconomic justice and climate progress — and prompted a group of Democratic lawmakers to try to repeal a monthly fee requirement they approved less than two years ago.  
&gt;  
&gt;The details are complicated. I’ll do my best to explain the competing arguments.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the result needs to be wealthier Californians paying more for power.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Electricity rates are rising for everyone,” said Alexis Sutterman, a staffer at the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “But it’s especially burdening those who already pay a disproportionate amount of their income on their utility bills.”  
&gt;  
&gt;With bills continuing to rise, “we want to make sure there are protections in place for low-income customers,” she said.

Meanwhile, the majority of Israeli Jews actually are the result of explicit ethnic cleansing by Arab nations who drove them out and stole their land and possessions following the formation of Israel.

From there it's about making cronyism less viable. This means pulling attention AWAY from the federal level power to centralize funds and therefore privilege to those at those top rungs. This can look several ways im partial to taxation reform to a land value centered revenue system. This again incentives attention back to the local level of improvements and smaller firms to get things done rather than huge subsidized privileged elites working with large federal powers. 


Those are short term benefits that decentralize our cronyism without weakening the actual economy of the country. In fact it would make more efficient use of her resources rather than from on high federal level.


 Longer term would probably be monetary reform. Breaking the monopoly of the FED. I'm still looking into these kinds of things about public banks as seen in North Dakota but not sure about this yet.

In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America.

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win.

"kpi5k7h","-1","Well my main argument is just really why Israel was allowed to have strict borders and justify it more than say if Japan wanted it.

 Because the point of the creation of Israel was to be a safe haven for Jews around the world regardless of their background. Sort of like if an indigenous tribe were to have full autonomy of their place and say ''we won't let many people in to retain the characteristics of our place as a safe place for those discriminated''. Liberia is kinda close to this.

  However, Israel has developed into a first world country at this point so naturally people would want to move there.

There is also of course the unquestionably antisemitic notion that Jews are promoting mass migration to countries while keeping Israel's border closed and ''white or jewish''. Obviously we know Israel is mutli-racial so ''white'' is a bad argument. Israel has many jews from many parts of the world not european, in fact most are from the middle east, then the ones from the iberian peninsula, the ethiopian jews (2% of the Jews in israel), Indian jews, latino jews etc. And sure they share a bit of genetic similarity but their cultures are different and Israel basically has mutli-racialness. Which is why i made the latino country analogy.



 If Latinos were dispersed all around the world from Spain, had ancestral ties to the Spanish and were disparced in Latin America entirely, they'd be mixed in with Indigenous people and Africans, have vastly different cultures and genetic admixture but a common theme of spanish ancestry. They are then given a part of Spain all to these people, call it the Latino Country, and it's sorta like an enclave within Spain home to all the world's Latinos, this means all mexicans, cubans, colombians, dominicans etc. all allowed to go, they would have different genetic admixture because (believe it or not) they look different but to most people most importantly they have different cultures","changemyview","2024-02-08 16:37:18","1alvzz3","Any-Emu-570","0","-1","0","True","2023-07-20 19:05:38","0.0","0.0","250.0","240.0","490.0","0"," Disclaimer: I know this is an antisemitic canard, I really wish I wouldn’t hold these views but unfortunately my bias for it has shown and I can’t seem to think otherwise from what I’ve witnessed so let me say some things before anyone tries to argue otherwise:

Because CO2’s radiative influence can only extend to ocean depths of 0.01 mm, or 1/100ths of a millimeter (Wong and Minnett, 2018).CO2’s total impact on ocean temperatures cannot therefore be detected, as the shallowest SST measurements are 100 mm – 10,000 times deeper than the range limit for CO2’s radiative impact.

&gt; The physical impossibility of obtaining a detectable (and thus measurable) CO2 signal is not the only problem in attributing SST warming to anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

Not to forget the air is colder than the ocean; the claimed ""reduced cooling"" is physical nonsense, a colder object will make a warmer object colder.","climateskeptics","2024-02-08 16:35:48","1alzrb6","LackmustestTester","0","4","0","True","2019-06-05 21:16:53","0.0","0.0","115251.0","76351.0","191602.0","31","","The Effect Of CO2 Increases On Ocean Temperatures Is Too Small To Measurably Detect","0.92","31","0","2024-02-08 16:34:07"

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

**3.** A fire in Port Huron, Michigan destroyed 1.2 million acres. This fire and the Peshtigo Fire were absolute monsters: for reference, they each destroyed 100x the amount of land the Maui wildfires from last year did. Port Huron is 100s of miles away from the other 2 fires. 

**4.** A fire in Manistee, Michigan wiped the town off the face of the Earth and left thousands homeless

**5.** A massive fire in Holland, Michigan flattened over 300 homes and basically destroyed the town.

\----------------

All of these fires were happening simultaneously, hundreds of miles apart, nowhere near each other. 

This is the strangest thing ever!! 

And some think a COMET crashed to earth that night and caused this outbreak of fires. 

There are a lot of very strange eyewitness accounts that support the comet theory. The descriptions of how these fires behaved is not normal. Fireproof buildings in Chicago literally melted in a few seconds. Witnesses reported balls of fire falling from the sky in Peshtigo. 

IDK what to believe but this is a weird one.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kpi0xsa","30","From the article: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest particle accelerator in the world. It will remain so for a long time, but CERN is already moving forward with plans to create a much larger collider.

CERN initially unveiled plans for the new accelerator in 2019. Now the center says it wants its construction plans to be approved within five years, which would put the collider up and running in the 2040s.

More precisely, during this period the installation will work as part of the first stage, when scientists will collide electrons and positrons. The second phase will be implemented only in the 2070s – then protons will begin to collide at the accelerator.

The cost of the new installation is estimated at 20 billion euros. For comparison, the LHC cost $6 billion and took seven years to build.

The new accelerator will have a circumference of 91 km versus almost 27 km for the LHC. This should make it possible to achieve energies of the order of 100 TeV, while the LHC, after modernization, offers only 14 TeV.

The new installation, thanks to higher energies, may allow the discovery of so-called new physics. Including particles beyond the standard model and, for example, revealing the secrets of dark matter. For example, the LHC made it possible to detect the Higgs boson, which was theoretically predicted 50 years before its discovery. True, many scientists express doubts about the advisability of building a new accelerator, since it is far from certain that even these energies will be enough to discover something completely new.","Futurology","2024-02-08 16:11:02","1alz6gf","chrisdh79","0","30","0","True","2019-01-12 21:03:44","0.0","0.0","14711738.0","566145.0","15277883.0","4361","","Will people again be afraid of the creation of a black hole on Earth?

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

Yes. Didn’t need to take a test. I found record of my great-grandparents Italian citizenship, went to the Italian consulate in NY, waited for paperwork to process and was granted citizenship. Didn’t travel to Italy. I did it all stateside in the US. All I had to do was prove my great-grandparents were Italian.

&gt;How do Jews who get citizenship get to live in Israel once granted? Does the government help them out? How does it work?

I don’t know how they integrate, and if the state helps them. But every Jew has the unrestricted right to immigrate to Israel and become an Israeli citizen. I doubt the government places them directly into housing and a job, but I would imagine there are programs that the state uses to help new citizens navigate these issues.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

Say you start with one liter of fuel.


You combust this fuel in a vehicle with around 80% energy loss. 


You capture all the exhaust and expend energy, corresponding to 2 liters of fuel, converting it back to one liter of fuel. 


In other words, you use 2 liters of fuel to make 1 liter of new fuel. And when you burn this new fuel, you only use 20% of it.

In 2022 they made it legal for anyone to marry anyone else on Israeli soil as long as the officiant was somewhere else (so a video call which is hilarious). It’s still tiresome that the old hats are holding on so hard to this, but hopefully it changes soon (after Netanyahu finally gets booted once and for all). 

&gt;so i imagine being Christian does not make you ethno-religiously Jewish when even being Jewish might not make you Jewish enough to get married.

The law applies to all faiths. Christian, Druze, Muslim, Jewish, all can only be married by someone from their faith on Israeli soil. 

And usually when this “not Jewish enough” thing comes up, it applies to *converts*, not just anyone born with a verifiably Jewish mother that the govt doesn’t like. If you have a Jewish mother and lineage, you are considered Jewish no matter what you believe or if you follow Jewish Law. But if you converted to Judaism, Israel’s orthodox govt doesn’t recognize anyone who converted under Reform or Conservative Judaism to be Jewish, only if they converted under Orthodox. 


There’s dumb reasons for this and it’s one of the things many citizens hate about the far right government there. It’s basically like Catholics not believing Protestants are “real” Christians but the Catholics are the ones running the government and the ones deciding who gets to be Christian enough to get married or get citizenship. And since they don’t consider you Christian (but everyone else does) they can do whatever they want. It’s extremely irritating to everyone except the extremist zealots tbh.

“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.

Every year after 2015 super elnino was warmer than 2015.  We will probably say in 2033 that the last 10 years were the warmest 10, and by extension the last 19 were warmest 19.

&gt; the 2023 temperatures haven't produced any mass mortality events or significantly reduced crop yields?

the 2015 ""acceleration"" has produced long term droughts in US south west.  2023 is causing massive tropical/Amazon forest droughts/fires, and massive hurricane basin ocean heat fuel that is already setting up as worse in 2024.

A lot of problems accumulate with just steady heat every year.  Sea rise is one of them that doesn't get measured in feet per year, until one major glacier collapses suddenly, but 10% annual increase would start at 1mm/year extra, but become 2mm/year in 7 years extra, 4mm in 14 years.  The 10% annual increase comes without further warming.

&gt; temps will never go back down again (no evidence to support that) 

With out CO2 emission elimination temps will keep going up.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

I would always send people to [Dr Charlie Gardner's thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1424792447062847497.html) as a first port of call.

Join activists, pester all and every political figure you can get your hands on and advocate for what you know needs doing. Find the local people already acting and help them if you can. The government and international community has chosen to fail but local community and regional politics can be more easily reached.

Communicate about is as much as you can. A lot of people are worrying in silence and feel alone and powerless when they're not. Don't waste much time with outright deniers, focus on the huge majority who are like yourself - who know there's a problem and don't know what to do about it.

Decreasing your individual carbon footprint is fine, increasing your political footprint is much more effective so that should be your focus. If you can do both at the same time that gives you credibility.

Since I decided to **do something**, I've had really surprising results, people at a lot of levels are surprisingly willing to engage.

It turns out real life works a lot like the internet. 1% of people post, 9% of people comment on posts, and 90% do *nothing*. That means just by doing *something* you're becoming one of the influential 10%. Even if it's half an hour a month, it's something, and that puts you way out in the lead in terms of action.

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc.

If the government's reasoning on Citizens United held, the first amendment essentially goes out the window. If they can abridge speech by restricting how money can be spent, they can censor anything they want to on the internet, because they could exercise control over hosting services and ISPs because those require money. They could censor pamphlets that you wanted to hand out on the street corner because somebody paid money for the paper, ink, and machinery to have those printed.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.

If all the ice in the Arctic melts, which it eventually will, a lot of this country will be under water.

Not to mention the conflicts that will occur while we all fight over said resources. And if you think the third world will just sit down and die, think again. If you don't like immigration now, you'll hate the hoards of climate migrants, which will obviously only add to the already increased stress of any society that's somehow still standing.

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.

"kphok9r","15","ICC reporting on this threshold is based off of multiple weather models for temperature rise. Now on average, those models predict the rise to happen in the next 20 years max, HOWEVER some models predict that happening way way sooner and predict a rise of 5C after 20 years. Turns out, predicting weather is super hard even for close future, let alone multiple years. That being said, turns out the models that predict super high rise are the most accurate models for close future as well, when you put them to the test, while most others fail to predict the weather even for weeks ahead. They relay mostly on historical aggregated data, while the ""hot models"" use better physics to predict the future. 

This is accounted as divination probability off the mean, but it makes you wonder, whether or not we might actually land on tails and hit the upper threshold and fuck everything beyond repair in the next 20 years.","news","2024-02-08 14:57:42","1altje3","Sagonator","0","15","0","True","2015-12-17 10:01:51","267.0","127.0","9554.0","19161.0","29109.0","4820","","World surpasses key warming threshold across an entire year for the first time","0.94","4820","0","2024-02-08 11:23:55"

“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23).

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc.

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.


  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**","Cmv: Israel’s borders closed for their own people while other nations cannot have this","0.3","0","0","2024-02-08 13:43:20"

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kphk070","9","&gt;“There is nothing magical about the 1.5 number, other than that is an agreed aspirational target. Keeping at 1.4 is better than 1.5, and 1.3 is better than 1.4, and so on,” says Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of MIT’s Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change. “The science does not tell us that if, for example, the temperature increase is 1.51 degrees Celsius, then it would definitely be the end of the world. Similarly, if the temperature would stay at 1.49 degrees increase, it does not mean that we will eliminate all impacts of climate change. What is known: The lower the target for an increase in temperature, the lower the risks of climate impacts.”

&gt;“But we should not forget that this is a global average, and there are variations regionally and seasonally,” says Elfatih Eltahir, the H.M. King Bhumibol Professor and Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT. “This year, we had extreme conditions around the world, even though we haven’t reached the 1.5 C threshold. So, even if we control the average at a global magnitude, we are going to see events that are extreme, because of climate change.”

[Explained: The 1.5 C climate benchmark](https://news.mit.edu/2023/explained-climate-benchmark-rising-temperatures-0827)

&gt;Adding to the nuance, global surface temperature itself can potentially refer to different temperature variables measured in different ways. On land, thermometer-measured temperature variables can include readings at both at the literal ground surface and at two meters above. Over water, ships and buoys can measure the surface ocean temperature directly as well as the air temperature two meters above the water. From high above, satellites don’t directly measure temperatures, but scientists derive land surface and atmospheric temperatures based on the amount of thermal and microwave energy satellites receive.

&gt;So, when you come across stories about the 1.5°C threshold—especially if you think you’re seeing contradictory stories about whether we have or haven’t reached 1.5°C— you should ask yourself three questions. 1) What is the dataset? 2) What is the “pre-industrial” time period? 3) What kind of temperature is being used? Those are the details you need to be able to put that story into context and compare it to other sources of information.

&gt;Remember, passing this threshold as defined in the Paris Agreement is supposed to reflect when human-caused global warming consistently exceeds 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial times. That is NOT simply when average global temperatures pass that mark on any given day, month, or even year. To know when Earth has passed that threshold, we have to look at longer timescales.

&gt;Why? Let’s look at a recent example. Global surface temperatures in September, October, and November 2023 exceeded 1.5°C above the pre-industrial period. Does that mean the Paris Agreement has failed? No! Global surface temperatures can be influenced not only by human-caused climate change, but also by natural climate factors like El Niño and random weather. When combined, these factors can briefly push monthly or even yearly global temperatures above 1.5°C; that doesn’t mean 1.5°C is the new normal.

[NOAA: What's in a number? The meaning of the 1.5-C climate threshold](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/features/whats-number-meaning-15-c-climate-threshold)","climatechange","2024-02-08 14:28:09","1alt7i2","fiaanaut","0","9","0","True","2023-03-20 16:22:50","270.0","91.0","1601.0","23237.0","25199.0","344","""[Earth has endured 12 months of temperatures 1.5C hotter than the pre-industrial era for the first time on record](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-world-months-15c-climate.html).""

This doesn't mean we broke the Paris Agreement (yet), which aims at keeping us below a 1.5° limit over decades. But it means we have our first year of those decades. And together with the acceleration of climate change, this is beyond worrying.

This also means we should support climate activism and stop criminalizinig it.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly.

"kphj5ni","6","&gt; I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return

Blinks as Gaeilge

Ireland has the right to citizenship with a provable Irish citizen parent or grandparent [(see citizens information) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/). That's very different to the Israeli law of return. Being added to the foreign birth register doesn't happen automatically and ireland will not pay for someone to move here just because they're a citizen. Citizens living abroad don't get to vote, they aren't entitled to social benefits, and don't even qualify for [reduced university fees in the same way that citizens who are resident in the EU would](https://www.educationinireland.com/en/How-Do-I-Apply-/Tuition-Costs-Scholarships/Fees-for-EU-Students/Tuition-Costs-EU-undergraduate-.html).

they can basically get a passport and wouldn't need a visa to move here. and that foreign body register step is not automatic. parents need to manually add their children to the foreign births register for them to have citizenship.

you need to have a tangible, recent, ongoing family link to Ireland. people whose ancestors left the island during the famine don't count. people who's had no Irish citizen in the family in living memory doesn't count. it doesn't matter what ethnicity the irish citizen is. and being ""ethnically irish"" (a concept most of us reject) is not sufficient to aquire citizenship. if an American with the name Ruarí McCarthy who spoke Irish fluently did not have Irish citizenship, or a citizen parent or grandparent, they'd have to apply for naturalisation by living here for at least 5 years. if someone named Pierre Nguyen had an Irish citizen grandparent, they would have more right to citizenship than Ruarí without living here, because it's about connection to Ireland the place as it is now, not the mythical idea of ireland as a concept.

The right of return to Israel is based primarily on  ethno-religious connection, right? you don't need a parent or a grandparent, even a great grandparent. it's about continuing a connection to Judaism. that's very different to having a current and traceable connection to it.","changemyview","2024-02-08 14:22:28","1alvzz3","moss-agate","0","6","0","True","2019-05-15 15:39:27","70.0","0.0","412.0","36555.0","37037.0","0"," Disclaimer: I know this is an antisemitic canard, I really wish I wouldn’t hold these views but unfortunately my bias for it has shown and I can’t seem to think otherwise from what I’ve witnessed so let me say some things before anyone tries to argue otherwise:

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

What kind of warming do you see in 5-10 years? If anything it's going to go back down after 2024 El Nino is over. Not to 2022 levels, but down.

What do you think is going to happen that's so catastrophic when the 2023 temperatures haven't produced any mass mortality events or significantly reduced crop yields? One of those 2 things has to happen for your predictions to come true and they both seem a ways off from reality.

So which do you think is going to happen and why?

While I understand people don't like the sound of those influencing elections there's no reasonable way to eliminate them without putting all of the power into the already too influential ""news"" outlets that have already surrounded their opinion segments with protections from court rulings. 


I hope I can change your view that CU decision was the boogeyman. You may still disagree with the decision and think the speech/convention/movie/advertisement/website shouldn't be able to directly callout a candidate directly within 60 days of an election but understand pushing against CU too much hurts our ability to organize at all.

Reality benefits the Rich. Who's more likely to be able to fund a movie by themselves a rich person or you and me donating to an environmental advocates group to finance a movie?

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kphi0m2","13","&gt; Climate change and renewables are moving too fast to use data from 10+ years ago or even 5+ years ago at the current rate.

How do you figure? If we can't use data from the last decade, what data could you possibly use to extrapolate? Renewables aren't expanding fast enough in any developed country to try and meet international climate goals except *maybe* China but at the same time, China's GHG emissions continue to increase. See:

[Not fast enough](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2411920-record-growth-of-renewable-energy-in-2023-isnt-fast-enough-says-iea/#:~:text=2023%20saw%20a%20record%20expansion,International%20Energy%20Agency%20(IEA).)

&gt; Short term 2C warming would just by annoying, 50 years of 2C+ warming is what does the damage

Precisely! But there's nothing ""short-term"" about it. The problem is - once you *witness* that 1.5C or 2C average, it's locked in. Its there to stay for the foreseeable future. Even if you hit net zero, it would still take decades for the climate sensitivity to reach equilibrium again, albeit at a much higher global average temperature than preindustrial times. All because humans keep emitting at record levels.

&gt; Asking people to die from higher food and energy costs faster than climate change kills them is not an option

This is pretty much guaranteed though. No asking required. Arbitrary or not, we aren't meeting the temperature goals set out. That means it will get hotter. Then it stops being arbitrary. It can only be hypothesized, but the effects of a &gt;2C increase are... catastrophic. [This](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1214858764/3-climate-impacts-the-u-s-will-see-if-warming-goes-beyond-1-5-degrees) talks about the United States specifically, but anything near the equator will undergoe much of [these](https://wraltechwire.com/2023/09/29/just-how-bad-is-climate-change-its-worse-than-you-think-says-doomsday-author/) effects with the rest of the world following suit.

&gt; why can't the plan to stop the world from melting just be about actually solving the problem in a realistic way and everybody focus on that?

Because it's not a problem. It's a predicament. The time to *solve* these issues was decades ago. Most of the people here weren't alive when industrialized society was burying the hatchet and defining our future.

&gt; Why does it have to be a mix of doomsday, minimalism, environmental preservation and just hate for oil companies? 

Since there are no solutions, these are all you can do. Mitigation is now the name of the game. My advice would be to learn how to live as sustainably as possible. You can't bank on revolutionary technology. You can't bank on policy change. What you can bank on however is a paradigm shift in our relationship to the environment when climate change problems really come to fruition. I'm sorry if it seems like doom and gloom but if there is no ""realistic way"" to stop climate change then a ""prepper"" or ""doomer"" mindset becomes the most realistic next step.","climatechange","2024-02-08 14:14:45","1alt7i2","sleepy_seedy","0","13","0","True","2021-01-15 00:42:21","0.0","0.0","698.0","1667.0","2365.0","344","""[Earth has endured 12 months of temperatures 1.5C hotter than the pre-industrial era for the first time on record](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-world-months-15c-climate.html).""

Two takes from different political branches of the ""climate debate"". NPR characterizes it as ""attacks on science"", though Mann is the one on the attack in court:

“Israel is multi-ethnic, there’s plenty of Jews from around the world like Russia, India, France, Panama etc.” Ok sure so there’s Jews of different cultures living in Israel, they’re still Jewish by religion or ethnicity, no one argues Israel is literally a fascist regime where you must be Ashkenazi Jewish or specifically some type of English Jewish (i know asheknazism ≠ anglo saxon it was an example), that’ll be way way worse but the fact is Israel allows people of Jewish ancestry regardless of culture or even race sometimes to enter but at that point it’s like having a Hispanic country, the one single Hispanic nation on earth bringing in Hispanics from all over the world whether they be Cubans, Mexicans, Colombians etc. all living in the same place you have an entire ethnicity at your disposal just all with different cultures and genetic admixtures present but they carry similar traditions - Speaks spanish, claims genetic ancestry from Spain like Jews to the levant, carries Roman Catholicism etc.


“The idea that Israel has Arabs”: I am not going to argue about the palestine-israel conflict because frankly the issue is largely for other discussions and both sides have justified literal terrorism (look at 10/07/23). Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. 

“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)

“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.


 Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. 

 

Where there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.

In terms of not having nuclear, it depends.  Most countries will need to rely on others to supplement their supply, this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

Intense glacial and interglacial periods created large sea-level swings and moved shorelines dramatically.  The tectonic uplift of the Appalachian mountains created lots of weathering, sequestration of CO2, and with it, changes in climate and ocean chemistry.

86% of species went extinct.

**Late Devonian Mass extinction, 360 million years ago.**

Rapid growth and diversification of land plants generated rapid and severe global cooling.

75% of species went extinct.

**End Permian mass extinction, 250 millions years ago.**

Intense volcanic activity in Siberia. This caused global warming. Elevated CO2 and sulfur (H2S) levels from volcanoes caused ocean acidification, acid rain, and other changes in ocean and land chemistry.

96% of species went extinct.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

Let's further assume that a 1MW electrolyzer and a 1MW fuel-cell cost $10M each, and a 2MWh worth of H2 storage tank $100,000.      
This whole lot is not very efficient, so we need 2x electrolyzer with 2 fuel cells and 2 tanks for a single battery performance, at a cost of $40.2M.    

Now you want 'seasonal'. let's say 1MW/2000MWh.    

With batteries that will cost you 1000 x $1M = $1B.

What can be changed is the degree of Climate Change- a 2 degree global rise in temperatures is better than a 3 degree rise which is better than a 4 degree rise. It's not binary that climate change will happen or it won't.

No-one can individually affect global CO2 emissions to a substantial degree, but the same is true with the example of voting, or pretty much any major issue, no one person could individually eradicate smallpox, or cut CFC emissions. The world is a big place, all global change has to be collective to some degree.

The UK can't stop Climate Change alone but we can continue to cut our CO2 emissions as we have done quite successfully (admittedly our geographic location &amp; natural resources have helped a lot in this regard). We're around 60th in terms of CO2 emissions per capita which is excellent for a developed country with net emissions cut to around half of our peak.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

You have to look at the total cost of the energy system - not just one part (like storage) in isolation...because the total cost of the system is what determines what you, as the end user, pays for having your utility.

Hydrogen has a lot of knock-on effects to add cost elsewhere (Mostly a lot more production capacity needed, beefier grid and/or expensive distribution system and hydrogen factories needed)

More costly storage systems with lower knock-on effects (e.g. sodium ion batteries, flow batteries, thermal storage where it is known that that power will go to heat generation, anyways) result in an overall cheaper grid - and thereby an overall cheaper price of power.","energy","2024-02-08 13:42:35","1alumav","iqisoverrated","0","4","0","True","2021-01-30 19:49:31","0.0","0.0","1.0","110776.0","110777.0","145","","Battery storage plus hydrogen can enable a reliable, cheap clean energy transition.

"kphboiy","-17","The new world is easily survivable.

Obviously MMCC is undesirable. It's bad. But life will largely just go on. People are remarkably resilient, and even the worst case scenarios are still easily survivable, as far as the environment goes.

Reddit loves its doom-mongering. But you, I, and everyone else reading this, will ultimately turn out fine.

You name a problem, and there are people around the globe with solutions ready to go. Once things become bad enough to actually need to deploy them, they will be. Many of them are simply not resource-efficient as things stand now.

People make the mistake of taking the world exactly as we have it now, and transposing it forward to a reality where global temperatures are even higher, and conclude that it won't work. Correct; it wouldn't. But if you see a bus storming towards you down the road, do you just stand in place and let it hit you? No - you move out of the way. In the same way, once MMCC starts to have real, tangible, mass-scale problems, humanity will adapt to them.

I'm writing this in case someone needs to see it - I know some people can get existantially panicked about this sort of thing. But there's no need. Life will be a little different, but it will most certainly go on.

**Edit**: As the guy below me had their comment deleted, I can't respond to the guy below advocating checking out r/collapse, as if that subreddit has anything intelligent to contribute. It's packed full of exactly the sort of doom-mongers I'm talking about.

There's a huge difference between sharing information and having reasoned, constructive, evidence-based discussion, and bleating out disproportionate panic-bait slogans based on a comically superficial understanding of any of the issues at hand, let alone MMCC as a whole. That sub very much belongs in the latter camp.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

* The IPCC uses a 30-year rolling average for temperature measurements, which is a lagging indicator.
* Large year-to-year variations and multi-year oscillations like El Niño make a long-term average sensible.
* However, due to exponential fossil fuel use in recent decades, warming is rapidly accelerating, making the 30-year average inadequate.
* Waiting until we officially reach 1.5°C could mean we've already surpassed 2°C in reality.
* A single year above 1.5°C doesn't breach the limit; stabilizing at 1.5°C means half the years above and half below.
* The rate of warming is accelerating, global emissions are not falling, and the carbon budget for staying within 1.5°C will run out soon.
* There's concern that we've underestimated climate sensitivity to CO2 and the impact of sulphate aerosols masking warming.
* Unexpected impacts are already being seen at 1.2-1.4°C, indicating underestimation of severity and timing.

"kphaq2z","1","I do actually agree in the long term with us colonizing space. 

But we will never get the time we need to actually successfully do that if we don't sort out things here. The requirements for us fixing our current environment are several orders of magnitude less than the requirements imposed by starting from scratch in space or on other planets.","changemyview","2024-02-08 13:22:52","1aktv60","FlashMcSuave","0","1","0","True","2014-04-18 08:40:28","888.0","0.0","9257.0","126821.0","136966.0","137","So you are Japan or some other first world country whose birth rate is no longer increasing faster than your population is decreasing. This creates an inordinate burden on the young productive members of your society to produce enough and subsidize the larger retirement population of your country. Clearly we must fix this! We need to increase our population growth so that we are creating more workers than we’re losing! And we will presumably need to continue doing this for the foreseeable if we want to avoid this economic catastrophe. So clearly we need our population grow at greater and greater quantities until the end of time!

But wait a second, did our chain of logic to solving an economic problem LITERALLY just become we need an infinitely increasing population? That’s ridiculous there is no infinite earth.

This right here is almost a memetic representation of the problems with unrestrained capitalism: you can’t enforce the artificial restraints of infinite growth inherent to a capitalist system on the real finite and limited world. And the fact the economic demands of the current system are viewed as inelastic compared to having a population which never decreases or just maintains  in size demonstrates how ingrained it is. 

People might answer “sure we need to increase the population now but not forever. We can work on having a steady population size create a steady economic state in the future”. 

I would ask “why the hell would now not be the perfect time to work at a steady state?”.  If you are a first world country that is facing these types of issues you have a massive amount of resources being produced per capita due to technology. Society has never been in such a clear position of having so much surplus that it could clearly maintain a constant population in good conditions if it figured out how to distribute stuff. We are also naturally having populations decline. If you don’t try and solve this problem when your own population naturally starts to decrease when else are going to solve it? 

It just seems like shunting the problem to the nebulous future like how we dealt with climate and environmental problems. 

Obviously implementation of the transition to an economy which functions with a constant population will be difficult and I am personally not equipped for drafting a proposal for such robust changes to our economic framework. But if the alternative viewpoint leads to the unexamined suggestion of REQUIRING literally infinite future population growth to maintain a stable economy then perhaps we should acknowledge the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that.","CMV: Discussions about the reduction of birth rate as a problem which needs to be solved seems to tacitly accept infinite economic growth as an unchangeable societal standard","0.8","137","0","2024-02-07 03:57:42"

Now that we are sending you to The End
That great god
Tell him 
That we who follow you invented forgiveness
And forgive nothing

I write as though you could understand
And I could say it
One must always pretend something
Among the dying
When you have left the seas nodding on their stalks
Empty of you
Tell him that we were made
On another day

The bewilderment will diminish like an echo
Winding along your inner mountains
Unheard by us
And find its way out
Leaving behind it the future
Dead
And ours

When you will not see again
The whale calves trying the light
Consider what you will find in the black garden
And its court
The sea cows the Great Auks the gorillas
The irreplaceable hosts ranged countless
And fore-ordaining as stars
Our sacrifices

Join your word to theirs
Tell him
That it is we who are important

This creates an inordinate burden on the young productive members of your society to produce enough and subsidize the larger retirement population of your country. Clearly we must fix this! We need to increase our population growth so that we are creating more workers than we’re losing! And we will presumably need to continue doing this for the foreseeable if we want to avoid this economic catastrophe. So clearly we need our population grow at greater and greater quantities until the end of time!

But wait a second, did our chain of logic to solving an economic problem LITERALLY just become we need an infinitely increasing population? That’s ridiculous there is no infinite earth.

This right here is almost a memetic representation of the problems with unrestrained capitalism: you can’t enforce the artificial restraints of infinite growth inherent to a capitalist system on the real finite and limited world. And the fact the economic demands of the current system are viewed as inelastic compared to having a population which never decreases or just maintains  in size demonstrates how ingrained it is. 

People might answer “sure we need to increase the population now but not forever. We can work on having a steady population size create a steady economic state in the future”. 

I would ask “why the hell would now not be the perfect time to work at a steady state?”.  If you are a first world country that is facing these types of issues you have a massive amount of resources being produced per capita due to technology. Society has never been in such a clear position of having so much surplus that it could clearly maintain a constant population in good conditions if it figured out how to distribute stuff. We are also naturally having populations decline. If you don’t try and solve this problem when your own population naturally starts to decrease when else are going to solve it? 

It just seems like shunting the problem to the nebulous future like how we dealt with climate and environmental problems. 

Obviously implementation of the transition to an economy which functions with a constant population will be difficult and I am personally not equipped for drafting a proposal for such robust changes to our economic framework. But if the alternative viewpoint leads to the unexamined suggestion of REQUIRING literally infinite future population growth to maintain a stable economy then perhaps we should acknowledge the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that.","CMV: Discussions about the reduction of birth rate as a problem which needs to be solved seems to tacitly accept infinite economic growth as an unchangeable societal standard","0.8","137","0","2024-02-07 03:57:42"

The pressure is what ultimately dictates electricity output. You'd rather dig a giant wide lake at the top and have a turbine way at the bottom of that shaft to power it.

However, at that point why not just create the same thing above ground? They've already done that and it's far more economical to build, rather than using a narrow shaft to hold water which will very quickly drop off electricity output as the water level drops lower. A weight would always give the same output from top to bottom. A lake that is a foot deep has a similar amount of water pressure at the bottom as a bucket of water, however, the lake can give more of it and that's the difference.

"kph7zn3","42","The Council of EU member states and the European Parliament agreed on Tuesday (6 February) to label nuclear power as a strategic technology for the EU’s decarbonisation, following months of intense negotiations in Brussels over the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA).

Presented by the European Commission in March 2023, the NZIA aims to speed up the deployment of technologies that can contribute to meeting the EU’s net-zero emissions target.

To this end, the NZIA aims to accelerate permitting procedures for industrial production sites involved in the manufacturing of components needed for renewable energy technologies, but also for nuclear power.

Meeting in “trilogues”, negotiators from the Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission confirmed on Tuesday the “strategic” nature of projects relating to nuclear energy, which are included in a single list of net-zero technologies that will benefit from the NZIA.

The text is “a mix of the two mandates [adopted by the Council and Parliament], with a more comprehensive list than what was proposed by the member states”, explained French MEP Christophe Grudler who took part in the talks for the centrist Renew Europe group in Parliament.

The agreement encompasses tried and tested nuclear technologies as well as future third and fourth generation ones, i.e. small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced nuclear reactors (AMRs). Their fuel cycles are also included in the text.

“The message is clear: the EU recognises that we need nuclear power to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal,” the French MEP told Euractiv.

Concretely, this means that factories producing components for these technologies will benefit from simplified permitting procedures, with deadlines ranging from 18 to 12 months for bigger projects and 12 to nine months for smaller ones.

The development of the infrastructure needed to expand nuclear energy in Europe will also be facilitated by criteria for prioritising these projects in public procurements.

Each EU country will be sovereign in defining the projects that will be considered strategic on its territory, and benefit from faster permitting and simplified administrative rules.

As a result, “the two types of energy [renewable and nuclear] are finally being treated equally as part of the reindustrialisation process,” Grudler rejoiced.

This was not a foregone conclusion. In its March proposal, the European Commission presented two lists of “green” technologies – one called “strategic” and a “net-zero” list with fewer advantages.

The inclusion of nuclear power in Parliament was not a done deal either.

After much back and forth, nuclear power was finally included in the single list of 17 technologies proposed in November by the text’s rapporteur, German MEP Christian Ehler (European People’s Party – EPP).

In addition, all nuclear technologies were covered: existing and future ones, fission, fusion as well as the fuel cycle.","europe","2024-02-08 13:01:29","1alv4kb","EUstrongerthanUS","0","42","0","True","2023-08-04 11:33:00","0.0","0.0","253679.0","30384.0","284063.0","596","","Nuclear power officially labelled as ‘strategic’ for EU's decarbonisation","0.95","596","0","2024-02-08 12:58:34"

"kph7ylq","14","Hydrogen has a lot of cost 'upstream' which is conveniently(?) forgotten. In the end you have to deliver a certain *utility* to the end user (which means a certain number of kWh).

If you do this via an inefficient storage medium then that means you have to have a lot more production capacity to compensate for storage losses (more wind farms, more solar power plants...neither of which are for free and need to be financed via a higher price of power).

On top of that, since you now have much more production capacity to fulfill end-user utility, you need to be able to get this much larger amount of power from the power plants to the user via place of storage. Read: you need a much beefier grid which, again, costs a lot more money that has to be recouped via a higher price of power.

So I highly doubt that hydrogen is the cheapest form of energy storage for days or weeks worth of storage looking at the overall cost of the national energy system (and by extension cost to the end user).

A bit more expensive - but more efficient - storage (flow batteries, sodium ion batteries, ...) are much better in that regard. We should be shooting for lowest cost to satisfy desired utility - not lowest cost in one subsystem at the expense of vastly higher cost in others.","energy","2024-02-08 13:01:15","1alumav","iqisoverrated","0","14","0","True","2021-01-30 19:49:31","0.0","0.0","1.0","110776.0","110777.0","145","","Battery storage plus hydrogen can enable a reliable, cheap clean energy transition.

"kph5nar","5","There's a few problems I can see with your arguments.

Firstly, Climate Change is literally a matter of degrees, it's not a binary. If only some take action that will still lead to a better outcome than no-one doing anything.

Also several of the countries you listed have taken some degree of action. India has slowed its rise in emissions in the last 5 years, as has China, the US has shown a steady decline from its peak emissions in 2007, Saudi Arabia is below its peak emissions in 2017, Russia has only increased emissions slightly since 2000.

Globally the rise in CO2 emissions was far smaller between 2010-2022 (3.84 gigaton rise, using 2022 rather than 2020 to minimise the reduction from covid), than between 2000-2010 (7.81 gigaton rise). The rate of increase has slowed substantially.

Secondly, do you vote? You're far more likely to win the jackpot of the national lottery (assuming you play) than your individual vote swinging the result in UK elections, even local elections. Yet most people do vote.

You can break many large issues into small, discrete components, eg aviation only accounts for 2.5% of global emissions so why bother with reduction of emissons in this tiny area, the UK only produces 0.9% of global emissions, why should we reduce them further, etc.

Just because an issue can be broken down like this doesn't mean by addressing individual components the problem can't be tackled.

It seems to me you're just trying to justify doing nothing.","unitedkingdom","2024-02-08 12:42:01","1alr4h8","Ill_Refrigerator_593","0","5","0","True","2021-12-07 22:56:00","0.0","0.0","103.0","140479.0","140582.0","86","","World's first year-long breach of key 1.5C warming limit","0.88","86","0","2024-02-08 08:33:10"

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK

It says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.

Now that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O

Now many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't ""political"" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN

So I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and ""pulling the plug"" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either. Americans have (albeit an increasingly less) interest or stomach for giving their political opinions in public especially in the dating world and I think that in order to not waste either parties time that should and need to change.","CMV: talking about politics early in a relationship (even on the first date) is healthy and shouldn't be frowned upon especially in the United states","0.82","551","0","2024-02-07 03:43:56"

&gt; climate scientists, as a whole, are not warning us to prepare for the apocalypse. The most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)—a group of hundreds of scientists working with the United Nations to analyze climate change research from around the world—names many serious risks brought on by the warming of our planet, but human extinction is not among them.

&gt;“If I had to rate odds, I would say the chances of climate change driving us to the point of human extinction are very low, if not zero,” says Adam Schlosser, the Deputy Director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change and a climate scientist who studies future climate change and its impact on human societies.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kph21l3","-7","These numbers are based on projected growth of renewables. Since renewables are now growing much faster than projected the 1.5c number is not as important. Climate change and renewables are moving too fast to use data from 10+ years ago or even 5+ years ago at the current rate.

If a new tech comes out that makes green energy even easier, the short term temp limit can also be adjusted upward... because we will hit static PPMs and declining PPMs that much faster. These were never truly hard numbers as people seem to think.

It's not that 1.5C has some big consequence, it's that projected over time that is a number that represents total impacts OVER TIME, but the over time part is not represented by the 1.5c or 2C limit. The rate you get emissions to go down is the real meat and potatoes of this equation because that's what controls how LONG it stays hot. 

Short term 2C warming would just by annoying, 50 years of 2C+ warming is what does the damage and in all cases the only metric that determines that is emissions going down and the only thing that really sends emissions down in any noticeable way is OTHER than total economic collapse, is renewable energy/green processes. 

Soo why are you focused on 1.5c vs 2c vs the rate of renewables rolling out or emissions going down? I don't get it! That's just not how any of this really works. There is no true arbitrary temp limite and even if there was the ONLY realistic way to deal with it is to put alternatives in place as they become affordable.

Asking people to die from higher food and energy costs faster than climate change kills them is not an option. Try to argue for it all you want, but humans would just wait for climate change to lower their population numbers and emissions that way vs lower their standard of living for benefits they can't even percieve other than over decades.

I mean cmon, why can't the plan to stop the world from melting just be about actually solving the problem in a realistic way and everybody focus on that? Why does it have to be a mix of doomsday, minimalism, environmental preservation and just hate for oil companies? 

If you're serious and you care, focus on the solutions, not long term theories nobody can prove in time to matter.","climatechange","2024-02-08 12:09:35","1alt7i2","Jolly-Worry-4630","0","-7","0","True","2024-01-15 12:34:53","0.0","0.0","30.0","5143.0","5173.0","344","""[Earth has endured 12 months of temperatures 1.5C hotter than the pre-industrial era for the first time on record](https://phys.org/news/2024-02-world-months-15c-climate.html).""

This doesn't mean we broke the Paris Agreement (yet), which aims at keeping us below a 1.5° limit over decades. But it means we have our first year of those decades. And together with the acceleration of climate change, this is beyond worrying.

This also means we should support climate activism and stop criminalizinig it.

This creates an inordinate burden on the young productive members of your society to produce enough and subsidize the larger retirement population of your country. Clearly we must fix this! We need to increase our population growth so that we are creating more workers than we’re losing! And we will presumably need to continue doing this for the foreseeable if we want to avoid this economic catastrophe. So clearly we need our population grow at greater and greater quantities until the end of time!

But wait a second, did our chain of logic to solving an economic problem LITERALLY just become we need an infinitely increasing population? That’s ridiculous there is no infinite earth.

This right here is almost a memetic representation of the problems with unrestrained capitalism: you can’t enforce the artificial restraints of infinite growth inherent to a capitalist system on the real finite and limited world. And the fact the economic demands of the current system are viewed as inelastic compared to having a population which never decreases or just maintains  in size demonstrates how ingrained it is. 

People might answer “sure we need to increase the population now but not forever. We can work on having a steady population size create a steady economic state in the future”. 

I would ask “why the hell would now not be the perfect time to work at a steady state?”.  If you are a first world country that is facing these types of issues you have a massive amount of resources being produced per capita due to technology. Society has never been in such a clear position of having so much surplus that it could clearly maintain a constant population in good conditions if it figured out how to distribute stuff. We are also naturally having populations decline. If you don’t try and solve this problem when your own population naturally starts to decrease when else are going to solve it? 

It just seems like shunting the problem to the nebulous future like how we dealt with climate and environmental problems. 

Obviously implementation of the transition to an economy which functions with a constant population will be difficult and I am personally not equipped for drafting a proposal for such robust changes to our economic framework. But if the alternative viewpoint leads to the unexamined suggestion of REQUIRING literally infinite future population growth to maintain a stable economy then perhaps we should acknowledge the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that.","CMV: Discussions about the reduction of birth rate as a problem which needs to be solved seems to tacitly accept infinite economic growth as an unchangeable societal standard","0.8","137","0","2024-02-07 03:57:42"

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

One last fact for you mate, at the time of the last general election, UK tax revenues amounted to around 33% of national income.

Compared with a world in which taxes had stayed at 33% of national income, the UK government will be raising upwards of £100 billion more in tax revenues this year.

The carbon capture foams are reusable foams. When the foam is saturated and filled with the captured gas, it is replaced by another foam to trap and capture more gas. later The captured CO2 and gases could either be stored, resold or converted into synthetic gas or syngas. Out of these options, syngas seems to be more promising as it makes it possible for us to recycle the whole process.

Converting captured gases into syngas allows for a closed-loop system. Syngas can then be used as a fuel, and the emissions produced from its combustion can be captured again in the foams.

6 For which reason did it come?

7 To bring justice to those who burn with passion to commit injustice.

8 And for what was its true cause?

9 I see an arm shoot forth a fiery fist, out of the corona, behind the eye of the eclipse.

10 That all who thirst for justice, in an hour after the day of sin, shall from the wells of God draw nigh to their lips. That the proud, Godless, and Rich shall be given into thy wish, a fiery pit. But in Eternity's wit, an Absence of Love is the presence of the Fiery pit.

11 Oh Creator, mighty and great God. Grant me the wisdom to decipher plainly what you have given me. So that I can speak plainly, and communicate clearly, the message you wish me to say.

12 Oh Foolish human, can you not see? Do you not have ears to hear? Well, listen closely. I will not say it more plainly than this. But since you are a foolish people, I will speak as clearly as the day of judgment. Give heed to my words.

13 Like the sounds of a rustling brook, those who thirst would be wise to follow its sound. Like lost travelers, my chosen ones have all wondered astray.

14 But listen to my words. Judge them by where they lead you. For can't you see it is the one true living God that is the lake of life? His depths know no end, His mercy is 15 freely given to all who ask for it. All who are led astray will burn in a lake of fire. They wander off the path of Glory, for temporary relief from a shallow well.

16 Soon they will know their foolish ways, sitting among other fools, longing to sip the grains of the sand from the earth, Yes! they will try to quench an unquenchable thirst from a spec of sand.

17 Oh Creator, I know what you are saying, your words illuminate my heart. Your great &amp; Divine messages aren't even worthy of human words. Your mercy is endless. What should I say to those who don't believe?

18 I am a powerful and mighty God. No evil can escape my righteous judgment. Before you were even born, my name was declared in the mightiest palaces, from the mightiest thrones. You mocked my servants. You mocked my chosen ones.

19 And in those days, I asked simply: Turn from sin and bring glory to the Kingdom of Heaven. But those days are drawing to an end.

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

**3.** A fire in Port Huron, Michigan destroyed 1.2 million acres. This fire and the Peshtigo Fire were absolute monsters: for reference, they each destroyed 100x the amount of land the Maui wildfires from last year did. Port Huron is 100s of miles away from the other 2 fires. 

**4.** A fire in Manistee, Michigan wiped the town off the face of the Earth and left thousands homeless

**5.** A massive fire in Holland, Michigan flattened over 300 homes and basically destroyed the town.

\----------------

All of these fires were happening simultaneously, hundreds of miles apart, nowhere near each other. 

This is the strangest thing ever!! 

And some think a COMET crashed to earth that night and caused this outbreak of fires. 

There are a lot of very strange eyewitness accounts that support the comet theory. The descriptions of how these fires behaved is not normal. Fireproof buildings in Chicago literally melted in a few seconds. Witnesses reported balls of fire falling from the sky in Peshtigo. 

IDK what to believe but this is a weird one.

"kpgvsy8","3","&gt;how efficiently AP production and the bioenergy alternatives can turn grasslands into edible protein in comparison to ruminatnt biology

This data is readily available.

To use the exact same materials for an apples to apples comparison, 10kg of dry straw will give yields of around 8kg of pleurotus ostreatus, which contains 264.8g of protein.

FCR for cows being fed straw is about 10:1 so 10kg straw per 1kg of weight gain, of which about 400g (I think) is going to be usable as food.

10kg of dry straw used to grow cattle would then yield 400g of beef, or 100g protein on average, varying between cuts.

So around 2.6x more efficient than a ruminant.

The space needed to raise cattle is also considerably greater - the same area required could be used to grow at least 10x as many pleurotus mushrooms, which also require considerably less water.","science","2024-02-08 11:04:09","1al7fqf","BokuNoSpooky","0","3","0","True","2019-11-11 21:24:11","95.0","0.0","702.0","10570.0","11367.0","1073","","Researchers report that replacing 50% of animal products with alternative proteins by 2050 could free up enough agricultural land to generate renewable energy equivalent in volume to today's coal-generated power while simultaneously removing substantial CO2 from the atmosphere.","0.86","1073","0","2024-02-07 16:49:43"

Even while political upheaval from the Soviet Union's collapse transformed the world around them, the family's farmland yielded crops, with water steadily flowing through canals coming from the Aral and surrounding rivers.  
Now, Bayniyazova and other residents say they're facing a catastrophe they can't beat: climate change, which is accelerating the decades-long demise of the Aral, once the lifeblood for the thousands living around it.  
The Aral has nearly disappeared. Decades ago, deep blue and filled with fish, it was one of the world's largest inland bodies of water. It's shrunk to less than a quarter of its former size.  
Much of its early demise is due to human engineering and agricultural projects gone awry, now paired with climate change. Summers are hotter and longer; winters, shorter and bitterly cold. Water is harder to find, experts and residents like Bayniyazova say, with salinity too high for plants to properly grow.

A good example is that the car insurance company i've had for 5 years now tells me that there are no longer month to month options for payment plans and that they only accept 6 month payments so they can ""Lock-in their premium package prices."" What does it mean ""Lock-in"" their premiums. Get an upfront payment, and sure you might get a lower deal and save maybe a few hundred bucks on it... but then.... where's the flexibility for those who don't have that money to spend for 6 month premiums? And what my friend brought up was ""Regressive behavior"" which is to create something, make it beneficial in the beginning with all the bells and whistles and deals and %'s off and bundles and then over time it takes it away. ""Oh we no longer have that deal. Oh we no longer provide that service, oh that's no longer apart of this bundle."" Why not? what happened?   


My other friend just got evicted. He lived at an apartment for 3 months, did an application for his income range, showed the exact amount he was making, what he had in reserves etc etc. They increase his rent by 350$. So then what was the point of qualifying for the income range to live there?   


""Well it's because of inflation and that's just how it works."" Well... i'm in my early 20's. It's clearly not working and it seems like it's going backwards. ""Regressing"" from how it was. And it seems to me that the same people telling us ""It's inflation and this is how the system and economy and things work"" are the same ones making it Not Work. And this may seem very barebones and ""top of the hour"" for conspiracies, but it opens up a perception. Being able to see Regressive Patters and Behaviors is the first step towards stopping it.    


We get told ""There's not enough food for everyone and we gotta fight over resources and land eventually and global warming"". Who said that? Same people? Well I just took a plane from one place to another and you're telling me that when I look down at what i'm flying over that we can't produce a vast amount of farms and resources in every state? All that empty space and it doesn't seem to compute in the minds of them that ""When you plant a seed. It grows."" hmmm.

Why are we told electric is the only form of power when in a middle school science class we get shown about 7 - 8 different types. Hydroplasmic power? (can't think of the exact name of it.)

Over that first 10 seconds your average speed is 33mph. Which brings down your 30-second average speed even 30 seconds after you started. After 40 seconds your average speed is 60 - and that's only because you stopped accelerating thirty seconds earlier.

The world is simply moving away from fossil fuel and every day the demands is reduced. The old mantra ""Gas is cleaner than coal"" is replaced with ""Renewable is cleaner than any fossil fuel, and cheaper as well.""   
 
If you look at [the 5 year graph](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/eu-natural-gas) then, for Europe, the war in Ukraine was an expensive wake-up call, but since then, with Russia basically out of the picture, Houthis blocking the Suez canal, and Qatar's North Field not yet in production, just the \*existing\* LNG terminals in the US can already supply more then we need.     

Building more LNG terminals in the US is just a race to the bottom, resulting in a multi-billion dollar scrapheap (*and guess who has to pay for that*).","energy","2024-02-08 10:04:34","1al88yf","mrCloggy","0","3","0","True","2013-11-13 11:18:42","0.0","0.0","661.0","86244.0","86905.0","0","","Biden’s LNG Move Is a Failure Three Times Over.

"kpgq6xp","2","&gt;So when I was in solar here in NY, you could not keep your energy you produced, you had to put it collectively into the grid along with everyone else, for efficiency.

You don't have to, you'd just be crazy not to financially cause NY is a net metering state

&gt;Battery back up sounds absurd considering the grid just pulls power from elsewhere when the sun goes down therefore making the battery back up ineffective

It generally just isn't cost efficient to use a battery to backup night demand if you are in a net metering state. More efficient to use it for FCAS and peak shaving. But in overall efficiency, it wouldn't be that big of a difference. Lithium Ion batteries have 92-99% round-trip efficiency

&gt;And unless the solar farm has transmission lines directly to the stadium, it just pulls power directly from the grid so the stadium must just use less than the solar field produces making the whole claim just a pitch to give off the illusion of green tech. The story should have been: ""Look at this solar field, it produces enough power in a week to power the super bowl at night for 8 whole hours!""

While you can't guarantee the electrons of that solar farm or battery are the ones you are getting from the grid. If they have a direct contract where they are the sole owners of that demand, then for all intensive purposes what difference does it make?

Now if they simply signed a 100% renewable plan or that solar farm is double or triple selling themselves(they just sell power to the grid, but people buy some certificate or credit claiming reduction), then no that would just be greenwashing

&gt;I understand the whole deregulation of energy supply from the delivery to give the illusion of control over your supply from the customers standpoint (which actually just means less protection for the consumer) that makes this green claim possible, but this just seems so odd. Such an American take on sustainability, oasis in the desert dripping in excess and made famous for gluttony deems itself green because of solar power?

Nevada only has deregulated gas, not electricity. So they can't buy from the solar power plant that way, they'd have to negotiate with the grid operator to make a special exemption of a direct sale or have ownership of the solar plant. (some net metering lets you charge in location A but claim the credits in location B, this is to encourage community solar for people with no roof or living in apartments who want solar)","energy","2024-02-08 09:54:14","1al3j98","hsnoil","0","2","0","True","2022-05-09 22:18:20","43.0","18.0","72.0","52670.0","52803.0","0","Ok so I'm not in the industry but I do have an economics degree and used to be in solar sales here in NY...

The story goes on from the egregious power needed for a large black colored arena to hold thousands of people and keep it A/C'ed in a desert and moves onto the contracted power supply of an endless horizon of solar farms a few miles away and the very large ""battery supply"" to store the power when the sun goes down. 

I'm a huge fan of progress and innovation, and lets not fool ourselves... The climate is changing and we need to do something about it. That being said... This sounds like an exceptionally inefficient process, and merely a pitch that is used to make live in a desert ""sustainable"". Am I wrong?

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

And advocating for lower birth rates is not the same as advocating for ""culling"". No-one is being killed when birth rates decline, just less people are born.

Lower birth rates will mean less people, or at least not more people. That doesn't result in nobody being available to do jobs, that's just a byproduct of our fucked up economic system that constantly demands more. One of the main reasons we have such a huge population bloom is precisely because of the system constantly demanding and rewarding more people to produce and consume goods (line goes up).

But if you're basing your understanding of this on an anime TV show, idk what to tell you. Go read some books or something?

This creates an inordinate burden on the young productive members of your society to produce enough and subsidize the larger retirement population of your country. Clearly we must fix this! We need to increase our population growth so that we are creating more workers than we’re losing! And we will presumably need to continue doing this for the foreseeable if we want to avoid this economic catastrophe. So clearly we need our population grow at greater and greater quantities until the end of time!

But wait a second, did our chain of logic to solving an economic problem LITERALLY just become we need an infinitely increasing population? That’s ridiculous there is no infinite earth.

This right here is almost a memetic representation of the problems with unrestrained capitalism: you can’t enforce the artificial restraints of infinite growth inherent to a capitalist system on the real finite and limited world. And the fact the economic demands of the current system are viewed as inelastic compared to having a population which never decreases or just maintains  in size demonstrates how ingrained it is. 

People might answer “sure we need to increase the population now but not forever. We can work on having a steady population size create a steady economic state in the future”. 

I would ask “why the hell would now not be the perfect time to work at a steady state?”.  If you are a first world country that is facing these types of issues you have a massive amount of resources being produced per capita due to technology. Society has never been in such a clear position of having so much surplus that it could clearly maintain a constant population in good conditions if it figured out how to distribute stuff. We are also naturally having populations decline. If you don’t try and solve this problem when your own population naturally starts to decrease when else are going to solve it? 

It just seems like shunting the problem to the nebulous future like how we dealt with climate and environmental problems. 

Obviously implementation of the transition to an economy which functions with a constant population will be difficult and I am personally not equipped for drafting a proposal for such robust changes to our economic framework. But if the alternative viewpoint leads to the unexamined suggestion of REQUIRING literally infinite future population growth to maintain a stable economy then perhaps we should acknowledge the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that.","CMV: Discussions about the reduction of birth rate as a problem which needs to be solved seems to tacitly accept infinite economic growth as an unchangeable societal standard","0.8","137","0","2024-02-07 03:57:42"

"kpgn35f","47","I'm so tired of how badly this is all understood in the public eye, even by people apparently paying attention.

The temperature measures used in the IPCC are a **rolling average of the last 30** years. This makes it a lagging indicator that will always be **behind** current trends.

But there is large year-to-year variation and large scale multi-year oscillations like the El Nino Southern Oscillation where the average temperature is raised or lowered by heat transfer in and out of the deep ocean, so a long term average is a sensible thing to use.

The problem is that due to our love of growing exponentially, **half of all fossil fuels ever used by humans since the industrial revolution has been used** **within the last thirty years**. So warming is *rapidly accelerating* over that thirty year period

So a thirty year rolling average is a very poor measure to tell where we are **now**.

For comparison, imagine you have a car that can do 0-60 in 10 seconds, and you measure your speed by a 30-second rolling average. Lets assume you accelerate linearly up to 60 and then stop accelerating.

At 0 seconds your real speed is 0mph and your average speed is zero.

At 10 seconds your **real** speed is **60mph** and your **average** speed is **11mph**. (The first ten seconds are spent at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 52 and 60)

At 20 seconds your **real** speed is **60mph** and your average speed is **31mph**.

At 30 seconds your **real** speed is **60mph** and your average speed is **51mph**.

Only at 40 seconds in, 30 seconds *after* you reached 60mph, are you 'officially' at 60mph.

If we wait until we're 'officially' at 1.5°C to do anything, we'll likely be well beyond 2°C in reality at that point.

ALL THAT SAID.

One year above 1.5°C does not mean we have breached the '1.5°C limit', because if we stabilised warming at an average of 1.5°C above preindustrial, we'd still roughly half the years above the average and half below over thirty years.

ON THE OTHER HAND

The rate of warming is accelerating. Global emissions are not falling. The carbon budget for stopping warming at 1.5°C with emissions at current rates runs out in \~65 ***months***. What we've heard recently from James Hansen is really quite scary, there's a very real possibility that for the past 50 years we've been partially masking the warming via cooling by sulphate aerosols, and have quite severely ***under***estimated the climate sensitivity for CO2 (that is, we expect less warming from a given quantity of CO2 than it will actually produce). We're also seeing impacts at 1.2-1.4 that we didn't expect until *much* later in the warming process, indicating that we've underestimated how soon and severe impacts will be, and there's a growing understanding that [the economic models we're using to predict economic impacts of climate change](https://actuaries.org.uk/emperors-new-climate-scenarios) are, for lack of a better term, bullshit.","unitedkingdom","2024-02-08 09:13:22","1alr4h8","LowQualityDiscourse","0","47","0","True","2021-11-27 19:16:59","328.0","0.0","4665.0","25267.0","30260.0","86","","World's first year-long breach of key 1.5C warming limit","0.88","86","0","2024-02-08 08:33:10"

1. Ranked choice voting, east choice that has no real downside and allows for third parties not to be a joke vote.


2. Outlawing any kind of campaign donation from private means and considering it bribery.*


* With an exception. I'm not exactly sure where we should draw the line but we'll say people/parties that poll below 1-5% can still take donations from private sources or use their own funds. If you poll above some arbitrary amount you HAVE to take government money if you want to run legitimately and you HAVE to participate in a debate between everyone who took that money.  We can sell the rights to air the debate but it should be mandatory that all parties who poll at some arbitrary percentage(the ones who took the funding) have to participate in it. If they really want to they still can host their own separate republican/democrat debate, but all major parties have to be present for the government sanctioned debate too, that way all voices can be heard.


3. Ban congresspeople from trading stocks. Pretty simple, but they write the rules. They shouldn't be allowed to own stock.

To my understanding, it is never too late and giving up is never an option. By the way, lithium ion and the current EV methodology is not decarbonised, and by certain metrics (the amount of haz released) it is certainly worse.

The task being big is only more of an argument for the UK to ditch the carbon and net zero policies and move into certain fields like hydrogen storage and decarbonisation of industries like construction and look to sell those products around the world.

We are currently well above the global average temperature of that time. And global is the key word: you are comparing a regional (Southern Italy) phenomena to a global one. That's like taking the US Western Dust Bowl period and question why people are concerned about the desertification of the Amazon.

For anyone who isn't aware of the Roman Warm Period, the highest temperatures in that region during the period were similar to or slightly higher than they are today in that same region. The warning there was due to natural phenomena, with the theory that the preceding years were cooler due to a blocking of solar radiation (likely volcanic activity. The rate of warming of the region was nowhere near the current global warming rate. This also applies to other regional climate phenomenas through the last 2000+ years, such as the ""little ice age"" and the ""Medieval Warming Period"". Human caused climate change denialists will also ignorantly or dishonestly reference these regional events as well, in their attempts to discount the seriousness of our current issue.

Lastly, there's a lot missing in saying ""Rome's prosperity can be directly linked to this period of warmth"" as an attempt to say our global warming will result in positive outcomes. You miss the drought/famine that hit Egypt around 40BC (Nile flooding was altered by natural climate change), the drought/famine leading to the fall of the Roman Empire that started around 235 AD, or acknowledging the various civilizations that were severely impacted by natural climatic changes through history. It doesn't take much for us to begin suffering due to natural variations to climate, but we've been fortunate that historically those events were regional. We were able to adapt by migrating...","worldnews","2024-02-08 08:58:53","1alprbj","SacrificialPwn","0","11","0","True","2017-07-24 09:23:04","2847.0","321.0","74.0","352234.0","355476.0","999","","Global temperatures breach 1.5C limit for 12 consecutive months","0.93","999","0","2024-02-08 06:56:58"

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

**3.** A fire in Port Huron, Michigan destroyed 1.2 million acres. This fire and the Peshtigo Fire were absolute monsters: for reference, they each destroyed 100x the amount of land the Maui wildfires from last year did. Port Huron is 100s of miles away from the other 2 fires. 

**4.** A fire in Manistee, Michigan wiped the town off the face of the Earth and left thousands homeless

**5.** A massive fire in Holland, Michigan flattened over 300 homes and basically destroyed the town.

\----------------

All of these fires were happening simultaneously, hundreds of miles apart, nowhere near each other. 

This is the strangest thing ever!! 

And some think a COMET crashed to earth that night and caused this outbreak of fires. 

There are a lot of very strange eyewitness accounts that support the comet theory. The descriptions of how these fires behaved is not normal. Fireproof buildings in Chicago literally melted in a few seconds. Witnesses reported balls of fire falling from the sky in Peshtigo. 

IDK what to believe but this is a weird one.

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK

It says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.

Now that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O

Now many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't ""political"" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom 

https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN

So I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and ""pulling the plug"" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either. Americans have (albeit an increasingly less) interest or stomach for giving their political opinions in public especially in the dating world and I think that in order to not waste either parties time that should and need to change.","CMV: talking about politics early in a relationship (even on the first date) is healthy and shouldn't be frowned upon especially in the United states","0.82","551","0","2024-02-07 03:43:56"

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

**3.** A fire in Port Huron, Michigan destroyed 1.2 million acres. This fire and the Peshtigo Fire were absolute monsters: for reference, they each destroyed 100x the amount of land the Maui wildfires from last year did. Port Huron is 100s of miles away from the other 2 fires. 

**4.** A fire in Manistee, Michigan wiped the town off the face of the Earth and left thousands homeless

**5.** A massive fire in Holland, Michigan flattened over 300 homes and basically destroyed the town.

\----------------

All of these fires were happening simultaneously, hundreds of miles apart, nowhere near each other. 

This is the strangest thing ever!! 

And some think a COMET crashed to earth that night and caused this outbreak of fires. 

There are a lot of very strange eyewitness accounts that support the comet theory. The descriptions of how these fires behaved is not normal. Fireproof buildings in Chicago literally melted in a few seconds. Witnesses reported balls of fire falling from the sky in Peshtigo. 

IDK what to believe but this is a weird one.

"kpgi701","23","&gt; Mainly, what are the real, actual nuclear waste byproducts?

It's a large collection of different isotopes, all with their own half life. [This diagram](https://blogs.egu.eu/network/geosphere/files/2014/12/Untitled.png) has an overview. It's a log scale, so everything that's not close to the top is a very small contribution. The first 100 years it's mostly cesium-137 and strontium-90, both with a half life of around 30 years. After that, americium and plutonium are the largest contribution. The plutonium can be extracted and used as fuel again, however, and the americium can be used in specialized reactors as well.

U-238 is the uranium we dug up from the ground. Removing plutonium and americium from the waste makes it drop to level similar to the original uranium once cesium and strontium have decayed.

&gt; Where are we currently storing that waste?

In spent fuel pools, in dry storage on site, in reprocessing sites, underground. It depends on the waste, how long ago it was in a reactor, the country, and more.

&gt; What are the real-life worst case scenarios for nuclear waste that leaks into the environment?

Slightly higher radiation levels, but still within the range of natural background radiation unless you dig up the stuff and take it home.

&gt; If a coal plant blows up, it would not have the same level of effect of a nuclear plant going full meltdown.

A coal power plant doesn't need to blow up. It causes massive pollution as part of the normal operation. Coal power plants kill hundreds to thousands every day. It gets less attention because it doesn't happen in isolated events and an individual death can't be linked to an individual coal power plant that easily.

A meltdown doesn't have to be catastrophic, by the way. It just means the core gets so hot that it melts at least partially. That's expensive to clean up, but it doesn't have to come with a release of any radioactive material.","worldnews","2024-02-08 08:10:54","1alms0a","mfb-","0","23","0","True","2015-09-06 23:02:50","0.0","0.0","24751.0","1263333.0","1288084.0","222","","Untreated water leaked at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant","0.79","222","0","2024-02-08 04:02:25"

Ok, so…WTF. This is everything that happened on the night of October 8, 1871:

**1.** The infamous Great Chicago Fire wiped Chicago off the face of the Earth. Prob the most famous and devastating fire in the history of the USA. 

**2.** A fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, destroyed 1.5 million acres and killed 2500 people. This is the deadliest fire in the history of the world, though most have never heard of it because of the more famous Great Chicago Fire, which was happening at the same time.  Btw, Peshtigo is 300 miles from Chicago and the land btwn the cities was unharmed; these were separate fires, happening simultaneously.

"kpghp8l","12","&gt; UK would be better off ditching all environmental targets and net zero and putting all the money into research and development.

Science doesn't always deliver the results you want on schedule, and it takes time. We're on track to pass 2°C around 2050, **there's basically no more time for research to make a difference** - what matters for the 2°C target (intended as a guardrail to stop us activating positive feedbacks that may take the planet into a much warmer state with no further input from us required) is the tools and technology we have NOW. If you fund research today you won't get the results for four to five years, then you have to do small scale demonstrations and ideally make it commercially viable, and by that point it's 2040 and you've only got ten years to deploy your new technology on a global scale. And because this is a cumulative problem if we don't make much bigger co2 reductions really soon the whole 2°C carbon budget is gone before 2040.

The scale of the task is so vast, whatever we need to do needs to be done so massively, that the shovels need to be in the ground on the big projects in the next couple of years at the latest.

&gt; An alternative methodology which replaces fossil fuels globally should be the go too, all this narrative push does nothing.

You can wish for it, doesn't mean it'll appear.

&gt; Decarbonisation of travel and heating should be a priority.

The current approach to decarbonising land transport (electric cars) is too little too late and can't achieve the required emissions in time. So behavioural and societal change towards public transport and active travel and likely less travel overall is basically inevitable. 'Jet Zero' is complete delusional horsecock, so behavioural change around air travel is also essential. There are limits to engineering, it's not going to get us there alone no matter how hard people wish it would.

&gt; Energy storage, specifically hydrogen storage needs to be invested into with our best candidates being encouraged to pursue this field.

Hydrogen is incredibly inefficient as an energy storage medium, because there's so many conversions that lose energy at each step. It's also horrible to store because it diffuses through metal and embrittles it as it goes, and once in the atmosphere it depletes the hydroxyl radicals that also break down methane. The 'round trip' efficiency of pumped hydro is massively higher, but we're failing to even build or fund the stuff that's half built!","unitedkingdom","2024-02-08 08:04:55","1alkh00","LowQualityDiscourse","0","12","0","True","2021-11-27 19:16:59","328.0","0.0","4665.0","25267.0","30260.0","59","","UK first major economy to halve emissions","0.81","59","0","2024-02-08 02:06:22"

Wouldn't eliminating your consumers be counter-productive?  Are they reducing the population because they want more free space?   We know they won/control a massive amount of real estate, killing off their customers makes no sense.

Maybe people suggest they think people add to global warming and we are just polluters ruining their planet.  Okay.....but I can't help think they are smart enough to see the real data that climate change is a hoax and used as a ploy.

"kpgg1ym","14","&gt;What are the real-life worst case scenarios for nuclear waste that leaks into the environment?

Three Mile Island is the gold standard worst-scenario nuclear disaster for a first-world country using 1960s tech. The official record is zero deaths, zero injuries, zero sick.

Still, cancer rates went up over passing decades. That's not to say that the meltdown caused cancer directly, but it most likely factored into it in some way.

If you live near a coal plant, you know where I'm going with this - coal plants increase the cancer rates of the local population.

It's possible to argue that normally operating coal plants are nearly as dirty, if not dirtier, than a nuclear meltdown. And of course there are also deadly power plant accidents and mining accidents.

&gt;Mainly, what are the real, actual nuclear waste byproducts? How long is their half-life? Where are we currently storing that waste?

Coal plants release radioactive elements into the air and water. If you want to compare things like half-life, go for it. Wikipedia can answer your questions almost immediately.

Tritium, the main element in question in Fukushima has a short half-life and is mostly harmless compared to what you get in coal ash.

In concentrated form, the danger is slightly less than pouring coffee and banana smoothies into the ocean. It should be monitored of course, but keep the scope and scale of things in mind.","worldnews","2024-02-08 07:45:13","1alms0a","epistemic_epee","0","14","0","True","2012-12-13 13:07:22","108.0","777.0","18588.0","26962.0","46435.0","222","","Untreated water leaked at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant","0.79","222","0","2024-02-08 04:02:25"

Coal plants operating normally spread radiation, toxic materials, and CO2.

With the amount of coal needed to produce the energy of a nuclear power plant, you are guaranteed to significantly damage the environment.

And lessen everyone's life span. If you use coal plants, everyone lives 3 to 5 years less.

That's a calculation without considering accidents, which can be deadly.

What mankind coalesces around is making wooden sailing ships that require no fossil fuels, and then start perhaps, an ironwood forests where it can still grow, all the way up in the arctic.

And then the sailing ships are tasked with dragging that lumber out into the ocean, or maybe a deep freshwater lake perhaps, and dumping it where it will sink below the waves. Now, to change the climate, this would take a looong time, and be possibly several dozens generations long project, but it would reduce co2 levels from the atmosphere, into tree form, and sequester it deep below the ocean/ground again.

Gradually perhaps the planet would start to cool down, and the operation could be expanded further as the climate in other areas becomes habitable to ironwood forests.

It's all hypothetically possible, depends on if we as a species could cease damaging the planet and not only eliminate our addition of co2 into the atmosphere but also start going fully carbon negative as well.

2 What do you see?

3 I see a fist of fire.

4 What is its purpose?

5 To warn God’s chosen ones.

6 For which reason did it come?

7 To bring justice to those who burn with passion to commit injustice.

8 And for what was its true cause?

9 I see an arm shoot forth a fiery fist, out of the corona, behind the eye of the eclipse.

10 That all who thirst for justice, in an hour after the day of sin, shall from the wells of God draw nigh to their lips. That the proud, Godless, and Rich shall be given into thy wish, a fiery pit. But in Eternity's wit, an Absence of Love is the presence of the Fiery pit.

11 Oh Creator, mighty and great God. Grant me the wisdom to decipher plainly what you have given me. So that I can speak plainly, and communicate clearly, the message you wish me to say.

12 Oh Foolish human, can you not see? Do you not have ears to hear? Well, listen closely. I will not say it more plainly than this. But since you are a foolish people, I will speak as clearly as the day of judgment. Give heed to my words.

13 Like the sounds of a rustling brook, those who thirst would be wise to follow its sound. Like lost travelers, my chosen ones have all wondered astray.

14 But listen to my words. Judge them by where they lead you. For can't you see it is the one true living God that is the lake of life? His depths know no end, His mercy is 15 freely given to all who ask for it. All who are led astray will burn in a lake of fire. They wander off the path of Glory, for temporary relief from a shallow well.

16 Soon they will know their foolish ways, sitting among other fools, longing to sip the grains of the sand from the earth, Yes! they will try to quench an unquenchable thirst from a spec of sand.

17 Oh Creator, I know what you are saying, your words illuminate my heart. Your great &amp; Divine messages aren't even worthy of human words. Your mercy is endless. What should I say to those who don't believe?

18 I am a powerful and mighty God. No evil can escape my righteous judgment. Before you were even born, my name was declared in the mightiest palaces, from the mightiest thrones. You mocked my servants. You mocked my chosen ones.

19 And in those days, I asked simply: Turn from sin and bring glory to the Kingdom of Heaven. But those days are drawing to an end.

By American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.

This isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter

We can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.

Cut and dry, the premises of my argument:

1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.
2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.
3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.
4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.
5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.

We have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable

"kpg9xa1","-14","I will preface this by saying that I'm not inherently pro- or anti-nuclear. 

Whenever I see the two sides go at it on reddit, I (in my flawed, personal, anecdotal experience) have never seen the questions I have answered.

**Mainly, what are the real, actual nuclear waste byproducts? How long is their half-life? Where are we currently storing that waste? What are the real-life worst case scenarios for nuclear waste that leaks into the environment?**

I often see a lot of hand-waving of concerns in regards to nuclear plants. I think a lot of the people on the anti side see that the worst case scenario for a nuclear power plant (however unlikely) is an enormous disaster for the part of the world where it is located. When the pro side points to coal being a disaster for the planet, I feel like they're comparing different things. If a coal plant blows up, it would not have the same level of effect of a nuclear plant going full meltdown.

On the pro side, I see a lot of people insisting that it is in no way, shape, form that a modern plant could ever go full meltdown. I, just on a human level, cannot believe that anything is full-proof. Steps can be skipped, flaws overlooked, shit happens. 

That said: I believe that we could probably operate plants in a way that is generally safe without a meltdown occurring. I just think the ardent shutting down of any concerns will never win anyone over to being pro-nuclear. From the interactions I've seen, e.g. Hello uneducated anti-nuclear twit #467,521, the pro-crowd seems really exasperated to the point of rudeness.

But lost in the arguing back and forth are questions like the ones I ask above.

Yeah the whole of Las Vegas would be shut down if we're only considering inhabiting places whose environment is generally amenable to human life. The desert sucks.

As for not using power at the same time as the solar farm is producing it, there are a few ways they can viably do this. The first is as they mention by using a battery to store the solar energy, then discharging the battery when they need it. This is actually the most 'clean' way as you never need non-renewables to step in.

The second way, which is considered 'green' by a lot of people, is to buy green energy credits for every kwh they use, with those credits going to the aforementioned solar plant. This means the stadium can just be fed energy from wherever is producing it, then pay the solar farm to push energy into the grid to kind of 'balance it out'. I think this is marginally useful at best and greenwashing at worst. It does nothing to encourage energy storage and grid resilience.","energy","2024-02-08 06:26:34","1al3j98","jonno_5","0","2","0","True","2013-11-17 21:40:20","0.0","0.0","2652.0","4735.0","7387.0","0","Ok so I'm not in the industry but I do have an economics degree and used to be in solar sales here in NY...

CBS mornings just did a story about the Superbowl being the first one 100% powered by renewable energy (we'll assume most games in Allegiant Arena are powered this way and the Superbowl isn't unique but whatever). The story goes on from the egregious power needed for a large black colored arena to hold thousands of people and keep it A/C'ed in a desert and moves onto the contracted power supply of an endless horizon of solar farms a few miles away and the very large ""battery supply"" to store the power when the sun goes down. 

I'm a huge fan of progress and innovation, and lets not fool ourselves... The climate is changing and we need to do something about it. That being said... This sounds like an exceptionally inefficient process, and merely a pitch that is used to make live in a desert ""sustainable"". Am I wrong?

Hear me out... So when I was in solar here in NY, you could not keep your energy you produced, you had to put it collectively into the grid along with everyone else, for efficiency. Battery back up sounds absurd considering the grid just pulls power from elsewhere when the sun goes down therefore making the battery back up ineffective. Right? And unless the solar farm has transmission lines directly to the stadium, it just pulls power directly from the grid so the stadium must just use less than the solar field produces making the whole claim just a pitch to give off the illusion of green tech. The story should have been: ""Look at this solar field, it produces enough power in a week to power the super bowl at night for 8 whole hours!"" 

I understand the whole deregulation of energy supply from the delivery to give the illusion of control over your supply from the customers standpoint (which actually just means less protection for the consumer) that makes this green claim possible, but this just seems so odd. Such an American take on sustainability, oasis in the desert dripping in excess and made famous for gluttony deems itself green because of solar power?

I would like to hear some of those arguments. As long as you have livestock agriculture and a well developed gas grid it most certainly has potential. 

But it is true that we don't expect to have the same levels of gas consumption in the future. The strategy is for the gas supply to only be used by industry, electricity production when needed, and peak heating purposes. Never for base load heating. 

Not sure I see issues with scaling. 

Besides any country going the way of renewables will require dispatchable energy reserves (as the rest of you are just figuring out now).

They're worthwhile for grid services but that's about it.ø and they'd never be relevant until you see greater renewable penetration anyway.
